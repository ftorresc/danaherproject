Going over ashi garami at Braulio Estima's school in Birmingham England. The British lad and ladies are doing a good job following some complex material from myself, Garry Tonon and Gordon Ryan. Mr Tonon is doing a superb job of showing the tactics he used last night to defeat Gilbert Burns. Though I am very proud of all the squads competition (shiai) achievements, nothing makes me more proud of their ability to teach - that way I feel very positive about the future growth of the sport - so much more important than mere individual achievement ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š Gordon Ryan even agreed to take off his crown to teach - amazing! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Thanks to @braulioestima  and Garry and Gordon and most of all, British BJJ which appears healthy and full of enthusiasm ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
