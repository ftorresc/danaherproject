Study: Every Jiu Jitsu athlete studies moves. Remember this - ANY GIVEN MOVE HAS FOUR CRITICAL STAGES 
First- set ups and precursors
Second - entry
Third - execution 
Fourth (if the move should fail (and realistically the majority of your attempts will fail on someone  your own size and skill level)) - exit/entrance to subsequent move  Only when you study moves in this four step pattern will you realize their depth and use that to succeed with them.
