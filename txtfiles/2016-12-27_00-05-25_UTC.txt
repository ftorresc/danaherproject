Knowledge and wisdom: From an early age I have always been impressed by the classics of Asian literature. None impresses me more than the work of Lao Tsu, in particular "To attain knowledge, add things every day; to attain wisdom, remove things every day." There is so much in this that pertains to our improvement in jiu jitsu. It begins with his crucial distinction between knowledge and wisdom. Knowledge is a RESOURCE. It concerns facts and ideas that we seek to accumulate through study, research and investigation. Wisdom is very different. It is an ABILITY. The ability to discern the RELATIVE VALUE  of these various items of knowledge and judge which ones are more important and are necessary and applicable to my goals. Initially students in jiu jitsu are in a rush to accumulate knowledge. This is good, as they are starting from naivety and need something firm to stand upon just to get a start. As they progress they get more and more facts as they get deeper and deeper into the sport. At some stage however, the student must, if he or she is to rise to the next level of development, make a critical switch in direction away from the basic ACCUMULATION  of facts and ideas, to the DISCERNMENT of which ideas and facts are most important to their goals and focus upon them. There must be a progression away from wasteful accumulation in favor of trimming the knowledge base down to the essentials that take you to your goals. A replacement of new facts for conceptual ideas. I would rather have knowledge of one fact that I use profitably every day than a thousand facts that I use once a decade. This shift from acquiring knowledge to acquiring wisdom is critical to high level jiu jitsu. It allows you to look at a complex problem and quickly see it's essential element so that a simple and workable solution can be implemented immediately.
