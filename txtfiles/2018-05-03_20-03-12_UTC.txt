LA Seminars: I always love teaching on the road. This Sunday I teach two seminars - First is at @5starmartialarts Shawn Williams academy 10am-12pm focusing on Triangle (sankaku) system and its relationship to leg lock system. The second is at Dymanixmma @dynamixmma 2-5pm on cross ashi garami/inside sankaku aspects of leg lock system. Looking forward to showing our approach to the game once again to our LA friends. Note also Gordon Ryan will teach at @pkgla at 12pm Thatâ€™s a lot of squad methodology for our loyal LA supporters! Hope to see you all and help to get our game to you and perhaps make it yours!
