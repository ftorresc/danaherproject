There is always an opening somewhere: So often when we go against a skilled opponent it seems he leaves no openings for an attack and we get locked into a defensive mode that almost ensures eventual defeat. You must have confidence in the notion that THE HUMAN BODY IS CONSTRUCTED IN SUCH A WAY  IT CANNOT DEFEND ITS ENTIRE LENGTH AND BREADTH AT THE SAME TIME. If resources are allocated by an opponent to defend one area of the body THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE BY TAKING DEFENSIVE RESOURCES AWAY FROM OTHER AREAS. You must have confidence in this. Our job is always to see where the openings are - they may not be big and they may not be obvious and they may not last long - but they are there to the observant and the watchful. The key idea is to present a STRONG INITIAL THREAT that makes an opponent divert defense to one area and then play from there. Here, Georges St-Pierre takes on one of his toughest rivals, Tiago Alves. Mr Alves has done an excellent job of defending his head, but could only do so by exposing his body - which Mr St-Pierre has immediately taken advantage of. This kind of thinking runs through all combat sports. Donâ€™t let tunnel vision reduce your attacking effectiveness. Always keep your eyes searching for the inevitable openings around the whole body as you begin an initial attack and you will soon be breaching defenses that once seemed impregnable.
