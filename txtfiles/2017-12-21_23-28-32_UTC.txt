SHOW ME A MAN OUT OF BALANCE AND I WILL SHOW YOU A MAN WHO IS OPEN TO ANY ATTACK YOU CHOOSE. Make your opponent’s BALANCE your primary focus - then you will have the luxury of CHOOSING which attack to follow with, rather than having to smash through your opponent’s full resistance when his balance is undisturbed.
