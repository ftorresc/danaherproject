The spirit of attack: Garry Tonon showed that a smaller man can carry a proactive attack strategy even against larger opponents tonight as he won EBI 9. Even when he failed to get a submission in regulation time, it was not for want of trying. Here he jumps into a flying sankaku (triangle) attack, showing the kind of calculated risk taking, backed by skills, required to make this approach work. Once again Mr Eddie Bravo put on a great show and format for the athletes and once again the squad showed up looking not just to win, but to do so in a way that shows the best aspects of the sport and helps it growth. I am in an airplane now at LAX, preparing to take the redeye back to NYC to teach tomorrow morning. Normally the redeye flight back from LA is horrid - but when you have a student like Garry Tonon performing the way he does - it's a lot easier to enjoy the flight home ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰ Looking forward to seeing all my students tomorrow - thank you all so much for your help in getting the squad ready for the big shows - we could not do this without all of you.
