Assembling the troops: The day before EBI 8 in Los Angeles I had the pleasure of teaching a seminar on back attack systems at my good friend Shawn Williams school.
We turned the technical lesson into a great final workout for Gordon Ryan prior to the big show. My good friends Romulo Barral and Kenny Florian came in - it is always such a pleasure to see them and work new moves and concepts. Here the LA squad relaxes after a great seminar and workout. Now for a relaxing night and final elements of weight cut and then it's on to the big show tomorrow.
