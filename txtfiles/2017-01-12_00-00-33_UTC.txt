Words and flattery can make anyone believe they are certain to win a match; but only skill, tactics and preparation can make their opponent share that same belief - yet it is only when both you AND your opponent believe that you will win that the outcome is decided. No one cares if you believe you will win - almost every athlete goes into a match believing that - what counts is your capacity to make your opponent believe it also - and that comes not so much from the mind, but mostly from your skills and attributes.
