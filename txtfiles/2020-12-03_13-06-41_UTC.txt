Garry Tonon ready for action! Garry Tonon is set to resume his MMA journey in OneChampionship MMA tomorrow as he takes on the very formidable title contender from Japan Koyomi Matsushima, an extremely accomplished fighter specializing in blending his wrestling, judo and karate skills into a very impressive package. It has been more than a year since Mr Tonon was in the cage, but he has shown his usual professionalism and training dedication despite all the difficulties of 2020 and is anxious to show his growing MMA skill set! Hope you all enjoy the show!
