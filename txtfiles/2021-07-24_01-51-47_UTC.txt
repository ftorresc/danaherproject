Be quick to critique your own moves as you perform them. Develop a clear sense of when they will work and when they will not. When you feel them begin to fail you will be able to read failure quickly and move to a second move more quickly than an opponent can follow with his defense and get a breakthrough. At the higher levels itâ€™s often not who moves first fastest that wins but rather who moves second fastest.
