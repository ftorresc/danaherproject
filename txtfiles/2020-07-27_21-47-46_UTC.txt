When working from open guard - constantly seek to off balance your opponent forwards so that his hands  go to the mat: A man taken out of balance is an easy target. A huge part of your ability to develop a strong attacking game from open guard comes down to your ability to off balance your opponent and one of the clearest signs that you have been successful in doing this is your opponents hands being snapped down to the mat. Remember - if his hands are on the mat - they aren’t on you - and if they aren’t on you - he can’t pass your guard or stymie your attacks. Here, Gordon Ryan, a master of off balancing from open guard, gets his opponents hands to the mat as a way to prevent him interfering with the ashi garami he has locked up.
