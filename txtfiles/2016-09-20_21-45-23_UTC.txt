Elvis sighting: Teaching leg locks at the Sydney Australia school of early MMA era standout, Elvis Sinosic. So much fun to teach at the school of an athlete I used to watch in UFC shows when the game was young and wild! It was an interesting chance to reflect upon the many changes in our beloved sport and the different directions it has taken since those early days. It was also fascinating to watch how easy it is for someone well trained in classic BJJ to learn and incorporate our leg lock system into their game when its main structure is explained to them.
