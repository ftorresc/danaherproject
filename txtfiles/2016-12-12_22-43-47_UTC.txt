Setting tough goals for progress: I believe that whatever progress you make in your chosen field will be determined by the goals you set. If your goals are modest - so too your progress will be modest. If you set difficult and challenging goals - the greater work required to make an honest attempt at them will ensure greater progress - even in cases where the goals are not fully met. I often create very difficult short term challenges for developing students. Their hard work and study in trying to overcome that challenge almost always creates progress. For example, Oliver Taza is a rapidly improving kohai student who is making all the kinds of commitment necessary for championship grappling in the future. He was looking for a tough assignment to gauge his progress. He entered a tournament this weekend - a 10th planet brown belt invitational at 205 pounds. This was a very strong test, as Oliver normally competes at around 165-70 pounds. To make it more interesting - we placed the goal of victory by submission in all matches - not easy given the rank of the event and the level of competition. Mr Taza trained with his usual great commitment and attention to the critical details that spell the difference between success and near success. In a superb display of skill he did exactly what he planned to do - won every match by submission (a mix of leg locks and triangle (sankaku) strangles) and each in a dynamic and impressive style upon much larger opponents. These kinds of difficult short term goals, interspersed among your long term goals, are one of the best ways to main progress over time and maintain a bridge between long term and short term ideals. Of course it's great when the goals are attained, as was the case with Mr Taza, but the deeper point is that even if they are not - you will be closer to your long term goal of excellence in jiu jitsu.
