Harnessing The incredible potential power of the spine: As a general rule the human body is a rather feeble thing - it does however have two remarkable sources of power - the hips and the spine. If you wish to be capable of defeating big strong and athletically gifted opponents - you must be able to maximize your use of both. With regards the spine, it has remarkable weight bearing properties when made into an ARCH. The spine can arch in two ways. The first is forward rounding of the spine that makes your spine into the shape of the bottom of a rocking chair. The second is a backwards rounding often referred to as a back bridge. Both methods enable a smaller person to carry and move shocking amounts of weight. Here, Gordon Ryan, a master of arching the spine forwards into the rocking chairs hair that enables inversion and elevation gets a big man moving in the directions he wants so that he can enter the legs. You must make spinal training a part of your daily regimen - itâ€™s effects will directly benefit your Jiu Jitsu. Daily inversion/folding and bridging will give you an arch that can carry a heavy load and move an opponent as you want.
