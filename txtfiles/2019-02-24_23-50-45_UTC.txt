Filming in Boston: Today I finished up the final installment of the ENTER THE SYSTEM video instructional series - The Arm Bar (juji gatame). Then we began filming more material for the next series FUNDAMENTALS: GO FURTHER FASTER This represents a radical departure from the ENTER THE SYSTEM series. It is a gi series and our intention is to make a series showing a path to quicker progress through the use of a structure that builds a foundation of essential moves upon which the sport is based taught with a level of technical detail and conceptual insight that cuts down on the time spent to get to a strong level of performance. As such, the content is much more classical positional work - the foundation of the sport. It is positional excellence that will create the opportunity for submission brilliance further down the road for developing athletes. I always loved teaching fundamentals more than any other aspect of Jiu Jitsu - that is where the heart and soul of the sport is, so Iâ€™m having a blast with this material! I hope you get similar enjoyment when you get to use it on all your teammates! ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ Heading home now on the train from Boston - tired but happy. Big day of training back at RGA tomorrow and looking forward to it ðŸ˜Š Wishing you all the best from somewhere between Boston and New York City!
