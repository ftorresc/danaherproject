In the majority of cases it is not so much any one submission attack that determines the outcome but rather YOUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A POSITION THAT ALLOWS YOU TO MAKE MULTIPLE SUBMISSION ATTACKS THAT CREATE WITHERING PRESSURE THAT BREAKS AN OPPONENT DOWN UNTIL THE FINAL SUBMISSION ATTEMPT GETS THE BREAKTHROUGH. This is the meaning behind “position before submission.” Here, Gordon Ryan gets close with a strangle - it’s not quite there - but as long as he can hold his position - it doesn’t matter as he can always renew the attack later - and each successive attack has a higher chance of breaking through as your opponent fatigues and must take greater and greater risks to make an escape. Remember always that the greatest submission hold of them all is PRESSURE OVER TIME and that the basis of pressure in Jiu Jitsu is position.
