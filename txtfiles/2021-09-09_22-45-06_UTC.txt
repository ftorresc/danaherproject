Last mission in Puerto Rico: I will be teaching a seminar in Puerto Rico on September 19. I am sad to be leaving the Island. Though there were obviously some sad elements to our time here, there were many more great ones. I will be eternally grateful to the many friends we made here and who generously gave time and resources to help us in our time in Puerto Rico. 100% of the money made in this seminar will go to gyms who let us train on their mats with no expectations of reward and to the Puerto Rico Jiu jitsu federation to help fund competitions for the many talented young athletes in the Island to show their skills in the future. We have greatly enjoyed showing our approach to the game in Puerto Rico over the last year and I look forward to a last chance to showcase it to a wider audience. ¡Deseandoles lo mejor! ¡Nos vemos ahi!!
