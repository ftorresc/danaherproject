I am very pleased to announce I will be teaching a seminar at @5starmartialarts at the dojo of my old friend and comrade Shawn Williams at 6:30pm Wednesday September 25 at 4201 Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. Contact @5starmartialarts for details and booking! This will be the week of preparation for ADCC world championships so it should be an exciting time in LA! Hope to see you there! ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—
