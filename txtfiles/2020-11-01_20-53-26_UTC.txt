First contact: Grappling sports are all about making contact and keeping contact in order to control opponents. Nonetheless there are many times when the two athletes will break contact and then have to re-establish contact and begin anew. These times of ESTABLISHING CONTACT that occur multiple times per match are times of great opportunity and great danger. It is very important you have a plan as to want your want PRIOR to making contact, so that you act with a sense of direction. You need two things: first, defensive soundness. You can establish contact in a way that makes you vulnerable to a quick attack that leaves you struggling to catch up. Second, an offensive plan that lets you gain the initiative from the onset of the action. So work from behind a sound stance and positioning that doesnâ€™t leave you exposed to easy attacks and have an idea of what you want to do as soon as contact is made - if you can do these two things the rest of the action that ensues is much more likely to go in your favor
