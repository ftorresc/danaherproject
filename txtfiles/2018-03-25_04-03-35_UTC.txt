A word of thanks: Part 2: Thanks to Mr Tonon’s family, especially Mom, who did such an amazing job raising this young man and fully support him through thick and thin, traveling all the way to Thailand to support him. Thanks to my sensei, Renzo Gracie, who gives us a space to train and freedom to develop so the athletes can progress towards their dreams. Thank you to One FC for believing in Mr Tonon’s potential and giving him a chance to showcase his hard work on the international stage. And thanks so much to you, my dear readers, who follow our exploits, tolerate our foibles and share our vision of grappling and martial arts in ways that motivate us and makes us try even harder. Bless you all from Bangkok - sorry for long double post - there are so many to thank!
