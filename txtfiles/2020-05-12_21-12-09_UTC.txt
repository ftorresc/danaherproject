Fastest way to control a leg lock scramble? Control both legs: Nothing is more frustrating when going to attack an opponents leg than the other fellow twisting and turning, heisting over your hips, scooting back and away to free his knee and all the other commons lines of defensive movement that make it difficult to get to the heel and apply your lock. You can drastically curtail that defensive movement by controlling both legs and sitting your opponent to his hips. This will immediately slow things down and bring order to chaos. When you can control movement and pace you can think clearly - and if you can do that you can win most of the time. So next time your opponent is flying about in your ashi garami, bring him back under control by securing the second leg - you will immediately double the amount of danger he is in and halve your workload - a solid forward step in the path to victory!
