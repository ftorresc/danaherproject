Traveling band: Garry Tonon and myself at LaGuardia airport getting ready to board plane to Montreal. Going back to where it all started - MMA with Mr St-Pierre. Another huge upcoming challenge for the Montreal native and the squad is happy to be a small part of it. Thankfully traveling with Mr Tonon ensured that I would actually be on time for the first time in my life ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜Š You know itâ€™s a sad day when Mr Tonon is the most responsible person in the group!! ğŸ˜–ğŸ˜† Looking forward to another challenge whilst also getting Mr Tonon ready for EBI 13 in two weeks! To all my students in NYC - donâ€™t forget our beloved sensei Renzo Gracie is teaching the big afternoon class tomorrow (Monday) afternoon - he carries a mountain of knowledge within him and really knows how to communicate it ğŸ¤—ğŸ¤— Take advantage! Canâ€™t wait to hear all about it when I get back! See you all Wednesday! ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸
