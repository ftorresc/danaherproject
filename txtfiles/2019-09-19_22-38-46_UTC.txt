Understand that you will never be able to lift people bigger and heavier than yourself until you master GETTING UNDER THEIR CENTER OF GRAVITY. only when you can under their center of gravity will you be able to lift them easily off the mat and into the move you seek to perform. In standing grappling this usually entails SINKING YOUR HIPS UNDER THEIRS WITH A LEVEL CHANGE. In ground grappling bottom position it usually entails SCOOTING YOUR HIPS DEEP UNDER THEIR HIPS. When you do this you can lift even very big opponents. When you don’t, you will be unable to lift even a lightweight.
