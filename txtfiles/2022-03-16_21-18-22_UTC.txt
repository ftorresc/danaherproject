Lever and fulcrum: Strength plays a big role in the outcome of matches. Thankfully however, there is hope for the weak - itâ€™s not how strong you are per se, but how much strength you can APPLY in a specific scenario that counts. Your APPLIED strength potential is very different from your raw strength. There are many factors such as position, fatigue level, balance and stance that can make a weak man feel strong and a strong man feel weak - but chief among them is LEVER AND FULCRUM. Just as a weak man can use a long lever to lift a heavy rock that a strong man cannot lift with his arms, so too, a weaker grappler can use his body to create lever and fulcrum to overwhelm a stronger grappler. Again, your raw strength is not nearly as important as your ability to apply the strength that you have - and if you apply it at the end of the lever over a well placed fulcrum - you will be plenty strong enough to get the job done against even your strongest foes. The weaker you are, the more diligent you must be in your study of making your body into lever and fulcrum, and the more you must trust in the mechanical power that it confers to you.
