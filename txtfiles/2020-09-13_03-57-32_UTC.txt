Victory in Connecticut!! Neiman Gracie won a brilliant victory tonight via flawless inside heel hook over MMA legend Jon Fitch at BELLATOR MMA in the Mohegan Sun arena. It was a shockingly dominant performance over such a great opponent - Neiman scored with takedowns and fisticuffs and showed his very dangerous submission arsenal in a truly well rounded performance. It was a great pleasure for me to corner next to my sensei Renzo Gracie and Jamie Crowder, who provided excellent tactical advice and coaching through a long and difficult camp with interruptions due to injury and the Covid crises. Neiman showed his ability to attack the whole body with submissions and strikes while controlling the direction of the fight. It was a true honor also to witness the retirement of Jon Fitch - an athlete I have admired for many years and who was undeniably one of the greatest welterweights of his generation. I still remember getting Georges St Pierre ready to battle him years ago and have always admired his ability and character. For Neiman to perform so well against such a great man is testimony to his growth and development. Hope you all enjoyed the show!!
