A win for the G in a Gi: Last night in California, Garry Tonon defeated AJ Agazarm in a hastily arranged match after both competitors had their initial opponents pull out at the last minute. The match was notable for being in a gi - Mr Agazarm insisted on this knowing that Mr Tonon has not trained in one for years and that it would prevent him using one of his favorite weapons - the heel hook. In the end it made no difference- Mr Tonon took the fight to Mr Agazarm utilizing other elements of his submission arsenal, especially his kimura and knee bar, to put Mr Agazarm under extreme pressure and win a unanimous decision victory. The two have a history and do not enjoy each other's company, so the match had an intensity that the crowd enjoyed. As he does so often, Mr Tonon took on a challenge at an apparent disadvantage and prevailed in an entertaining and memorable way - showing that technical sophistication and entertainment don't have to be opposites. Well done to Fight2Win for their production and getting the most out of a show beset by last minute withdrawals. I wonder if wearing the gi again made Mr Tonon a little nostalgic...
