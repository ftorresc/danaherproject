Last workout: Here is the crew after a final light sweat in midtown Manhattan as Mr St-Pierre ran through his final drills in preparation for tomorrow night. Itâ€™s been a pleasure to watch him working with Firas Zahabi, Freddie Roach and Jorge Blanco in standing position. Looking very sharp from feet to floor. Back to Hotel now for hijinks, stories, laughter. Wishing you all the best wherever you are ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
