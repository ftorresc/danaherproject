Newark airport: Heading to England for Polaris 4 where Garry Tonon takes on the outstanding and physically very powerful Gilbert Burns in fifteen minutes of submission grappling action. Mr Tonon has trained extremely well. Fellow squad member Gordon Ryan is traveling with us also as he prepares for EBI 9, the heavyweight competition where he will be by far the smallest competitor - a situation that is becoming normal for the squad now. After we return Monday its a quick turn around to California for Mr Ryan's show. It's a privilege to be able to go to so many shows to exhibit our approach to grappling against such distinguished competition
