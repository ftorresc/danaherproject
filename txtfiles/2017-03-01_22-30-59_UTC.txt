The Return: UFC President Mr Dana White publicly announced today what has been negotiated back and forth over the last few months between his company and Georges St-Pierre - a return to the octagon that would involve something new and extraordinarily challenging. That new challenge will be a rise in weight class against the new middleweight champion, Micheal Bisping. Mr Bisping won a sensational match via knockout over Luke Rockhold to add to a hard fought win over the greatest middleweight of all time, Anderson Silva and a subsequent win over middleweight legend Dan Henderson. Mr Bisping started his career as a light heavyweight, but dropped down to become a huge middle weight. In contrast, Mr St-Pierre is by contemporary standards an average size welterweight with a walk around weight of 192 pounds his entire career. Interestingly his win over Dan Henderson made Mr Bisping the athlete with the most wins in UFC history - overtaking Mr St-Pierre in this distinction (though Mr St-Pierre has far fewer losses). Going up weight divisions is always a tricky affair as the danger of injury in training with bigger partners goes up and the penalty for making mistakes in a match is higher, but Mr St-Pierre is determined to push forward into the challenge and take this new phase of his career in this interesting new direction. He has been doing well in his grappling training and is still in great shape despite three years away from professional fighting- two great champions, both beginning their careers at roughly the same time, both outspoken proponents of better testing for PED's in MMA, both holding at some time the record for wins in the octagon, one much bigger than the other - this should be interesting! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
