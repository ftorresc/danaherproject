As a coach or mentor there are two things I can never give you. Two things that only you can provide. The first is a deep underlying PASSION for what you do. I can deepen that passion, fuel it, strengthen it - but only YOU can CREATE it; and you either have it or you donâ€™t. The second is the ability to PULL THE TRIGGER when opportunity presents itself. I can teach you all manner of techniques, tactics, game plans, risk calculations, strategy, drills etc etc. but in the end, at the crucial moment, ONLY YOU CAN MAKE THE NAKED CHOICE TO PULL THE TRIGGER. In jiu jitsu and in life - much can be offered to you - but these two things, passion and the ability to seize the moment and pull the trigger, these two must come from within you - they are yours and yours alone.
