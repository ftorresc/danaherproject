Success in London: The squad won three out of three at Polaris 5 grappling championships here in England. All three matches were tough, hard fought affairs where positional domination on the floor, takedowns on the feet and a higher work rate of submission attempts got the wins. The squad always looks to win via submission, tonight we got close, with some training, next time we will work even harder for the breakthrough! Thanks to Polaris for putting on a great event in a great location. Thanks to our opponents who showed great skill and always provide us the tough resistance that creates improvements in ourselves. I fly home very early tomorrow to get back to teaching the other squad members in preparation for ADCC. By midweek everyone will be back in the Apple working towards new goals ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š Hope you all enjoyed the show!
