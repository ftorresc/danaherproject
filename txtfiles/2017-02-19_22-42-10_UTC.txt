Three the hard way: If you are to accomplish anything great in life, be prepared to work hard over time with a sound plan. Outstanding kohai students Oliver Taza and Stanley Rosa both have ambitions. Mr Taza will compete soon in the upcoming welterweight EBI alongside Gordon Ryan. Every Monday he trains three classes with me (in addition to the rest of the week). The first two at RGA in midtown Manhattan and the last at night all the way up in the Bronx at my student and friend, Doug Pelinkovic's Dojo. Up at 6am for the first class and getting home at 11pm to get ready for the next day's training. Many people have ambition, but only a few have the discipline, patience and work ethic to make those ambitions reality. It helps a lot to have equally ambitious and hard working partners. Here Mr Taza works with one of his best training partners, Stanley Rosa, as I push them through front headlock drills and then into sparring. I always like to see dojo friendships build between like minded athletes - the road to the top is a long one - but easier when walked in good company.
