What a night! Sensei Renzo had an amazing comeback tonight! He finished Yuki Kondo here in Manila tonight in the second round with a beautifully applied strangle from the back. He controlled the action from standing to ground and showed his immense knowledge by switching grips to break through against strong resistance. We are all so proud to see him prevail so convincingly against such a tough opponent. Also great to to see two generations of Renzo Gracie Academy athletes showcase their winning ways ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š I am always very proud to be a student of this great man - but tonight was something special to behold. Thanks so much for all your support. Canâ€™t wait to see all our dedicated students back at RGA in NYC and tell the full story of senseiâ€™s amazing night! See you all soon! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—
