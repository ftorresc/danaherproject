Gripping from guard is very different from most scenarios: When people talk about gripping skills they usually mean gripping with the HANDS. In fact in Jiu jitsu we can play guard position with four limbs not two. You will be expected to form connection with hand AND feet. All your life you have learned to contour your hand to maximize grip. Now you must learn the same again with your feet. The key is to CONTOUR your feet around the target - just as you do with your hands. If you want to PULL with your feet, we generally use your shoelaces and retract our toes. If you want to PUSH - use the sole of the foot. Learning to grip Qi the tour feet from guard is one of the first skills that pertains to the Jiu jitsu game
