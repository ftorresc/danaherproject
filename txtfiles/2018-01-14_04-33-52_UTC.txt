Teaching in LA: I went over some of the core principles of our leg locking system at @dynamixmma in Santa Monica today. They did a great job of hosting, bringing in almost ninety people who bravely put up with my foul language and rough manner and overall horribleness. Here I demonstrate the delicate interplay between upper body and lower body forces that are required for maximum effect. When this is done well a staggering amount of force can be brought to bear upon the knee and ankle, even with one hand as I demonstrate here. Tomorrow itâ€™s on to my great friend and fellow Renzo Gracie Alumni, @5starmartialarts Shawn Williams for more jiu jitsu adventures. Wishing you all the best from sunny California!
