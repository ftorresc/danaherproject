Here is a great clip of outstanding grappling and MMA athlete Erin Blanchfield in training at RGA. Ms Blanchfield first started coming to train with the squad in the blue basement from Silver Fox academy in New Jersey and wanted to prepare for an EBI grappling show. She was just eighteen at the time and entered EBI 12 female flyweights as an unknown among several world champions. She stunned everyone by winning the event - the youngest ever to do so. Her primary interest however, is MMA where she is unbeaten and signed with Invicta. On November 16 she fights again. Here she is going through her MMA training and grappling training in NYC. Itâ€™s amazing to see her work ethic in operation every day. She comes all the way from New Jersey to toil in two sports every day. Keep up with this amazing young woman as she climbs to the top @blanchfield_mma and  exhibits daily the purposeful action that over time produces champions and makes dreams reality.
