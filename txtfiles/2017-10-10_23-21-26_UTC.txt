Side by side in Montreal: Interesting coach experience in Montreal coaching Georges St-Pierre for his upcoming MMA bout against the great Michael Bisping and Garry Tonon for his upcoming EBI 13 event in LA. Obviously there are big differences between the skills and tactics of the two sports and it was fascinating to watch the athletes interact in both domains. Here, my black belt student Firas Zahabi, head of Tristar MMA gym and I discuss the dayâ€™s training and plan for the next few weeks in the light of our observations. Heading home to NYC now for a full day of teaching tomorrow back in the blue basement at RGA. Another day, another airport lounge and a set of problems in need of solutions ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š To all my dear students back in NYC - see you tomorrow- letâ€™s get the room ready to sharpen the squad!
