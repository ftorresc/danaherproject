Back in Black: Nicky Ryan had a great weekend - winning first place honors in the Global Grappling League submission only event in Ithaca NY yesterday. Mr Ryan traveled upstate with Team mate Oliver Taza. Mr Ryan competed in the eight man elimination 145 pound division. He won his first two matches with a stranglehold and Achilles lock before taking on the very talented Junny Ocasio, fighting out of Unity gym in NYC. Mr Ryan won a thrilling decision in overtime on riding time advantage to take first place. As always it's a pleasure to see the kohai (junior students) going out and performing so well in local tournaments as they make the improvements to get to their goals. Mr Ryan has been training very well and continues to amaze me with his development for such a young man - just fifteen and competing in adult divisions and doing so well. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
