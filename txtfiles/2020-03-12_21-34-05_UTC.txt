Gaining a superpower: Imagine if you were offered to power of being able to see five seconds into the future. Would it not make you almost impossible to defeat in combat? You could literally avoid or counter any move before it can be applied against you. In a way - Jiu Jitsu gives you that superpower. One of the great benefits of physical control over an opponent is the RESTRICTIONS ON POSSIBILITIES it imposes upon him. A match or fight can be a wild and unpredictable affair. We have no idea what our opponent will do at the onset of a match - but as we get further and further into the business of control we cut down our opponents movement options into a few predictable alternatives. By the time we get to finishing positions a good Jiu Jitsu player can literally read the future as there are only a couple of realistic options for an opponent to take. YOU MUST LEARN TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS INCREDIBLE POWER TO KNOW WHAT AN OPPONENT WILL DO AHEAD OF TIME. From all your favorite finishing positions, map out the few realistic counters and plan your counters to those counters. Then work backwards from the finish all the way to the set up, mapping out the main reactions to your best moves. You will be pleasantly surprised by how few realistic reactions there are to the more controlling positions in the sport. This means that once you gain advantage, you will be able to funnel an opponent into progressively fewer and fewer options as you work towards finishing positions. When you know where an opponent will be and what he will be doing a few seconds from now - your job will be a LOT easier.
