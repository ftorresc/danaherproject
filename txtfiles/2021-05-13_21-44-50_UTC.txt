When you watch Jiu jitsu: Every time you watch Jiu jitsu you get a chance to train your mind in the same way that every time you step on the mat you get a chance to work your body. See it for what it is - an opportunity to train. Donâ€™t watch passively. Most people just watch to see the outcome. The outcome only affects the players. In order to benefit YOU, you must become a PARTICIPANT not an just an OBSERVER. That means putting yourself mentally into the action. You must see yourself as one of the athletes and ask yourself what you would be doing second by second in response to the action unfolding in front of you. Passively watching for the outcome is fun - but improvement will come from actively engaging on a mental level where you become a mental participant. Then watching is transformed from being an enjoyment to a source of progress that you can carry over into your next physical training session
