Progressive training programs: It is of the first importance that you design training programs that continually refine existing skills whilst adding new ones.  So often I see people who make a certain amount of progress and then stop, often resulting in drop out or stagnation. When I first started training young Georges St-Pierre, he was just a blue belt. He would come down part time and learn what he could. When he first fought Matt Hughes, he was very inexperienced and his overall game, though filled with enthusiasm and talent, was unrefined. It was just his third fight in the octagon against the man who that time, was the most dominant welterweight in the sports history. Amazingly, Mr St-Pierre came out on fire and took Mr Hughes down and appeared to be winning the first round - only to be caught in a beginner level mistake and lose by armbar submission. The next time the two fought, a greatly matured Georges St-Pierre knocked Mr Hughes out to win the title. When they met a third time, Mr St-Pierre was a very good black belt in Jiu jitsu. I encouraged him to show this taking the fight to the floor and looking for submissions, even though the floor was Mr Hughes forte and it would have been safer to look for a standing KO as he had done in the second match. When the fight went to the floor it was immediately apparent just how much progress had been made. Mr St-Pierre easily passed guard into dominant pins and finished his legendary opponent with the very same armbar that he  once lost to. Underneath the irony was an important lesson in progress. Time and training, ordered according to a rational plan, can completely reverse the relative skills levels of two athletes. It is so important that training programs be monitored to ensure progress is being made and that degeneration has not set in. Only in this way can you reasonably expect to defeat tomorrow the people who are beating you today.
