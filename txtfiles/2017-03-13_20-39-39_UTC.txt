My sensei, Renzo Gracie, always taught me to look for ways to apply the lessons of jiu jitsu to other aspects of our lives. This is why I constantly teach jiu jitsu as problem solving activity. Life itself is mostly a tale of our attempts to solve the myriad problems that life throws at us minute by minute, hour by hour and year by year. So many of the tactical themes of our sport apply to situations outside the dojo. I wanted to convey this theme to a larger audience and the writers of the popular TV show "Billions" did a fine job of working it into season 2 of the show. Here, Paul Giamatti gains insight from technique and tactics in ways that his character can use in his great struggles against his rival. I am sure all of you have had similar experiences of jiu jitsu influencing your thoughts and actions far from the tatame.
