When the arms can’t get the breakthrough you seek - let your legs do the work: A fundamental feature of the human body is the discrepancy between our upper body which is weak and tires quickly, and our lower body which is strong and possesses remarkable endurance. So often we grapple predominantly with the upper body because it feels more coordinated and responsive than our untutored lower bodies. When attacking the back it’s good to take advantage of the precise movement and dexterity of the arms to apply our strangles. However, if our opponent has strong defensive hand fighting skills we often get shut out. That’s when it’s time for you to bring in the power of the legs. The best method is that of utilizing the incredible power of the triangle - USHIRO SANKAKU. This will quickly overwhelm your opponent’s hand defenses and often give you the victory.
