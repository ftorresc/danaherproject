Big Tom DeBlass getting ready for action with the squad: This Saturday night in Bayville New Jersey at Fight2Win 43, my good friend and comrade Tom DeBlass will take on the great Joao Assis of Brazil - former ADCC world gold and silver medalist. These two titans have battled previously to a draw and both are looking to show how improvements in their game will make a difference on Saturday. Mr DeBlass is a student of one of my most important mentors, my senpai, Ricardo Almeida and a very well known and respected member of the BJJ community. In preparation for this bout he came in weekly to train squad style and impressed everyone with his drive and commitment. Hats off to Fight2Win for continuing to put on great shows with impressive matchups. They do a great job of building grass roots support through local athletes, along with big name main events. They are continuing to grow and develop whilst offering developing athletes a great venue to showcase their skills. This will be a ten minute submission only match, but if it should go the distance, a judgment will be made on the basis of submission aggression and positional control - skills that both athletes excel in. Looking forward to a fire cracker when these two meet - big men, big skill sets, big following, all going down at the big show!
