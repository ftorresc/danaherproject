Confidence may be a mental attribute, but it's birth is physical - the hours, months and years of training that create superior technique which leads to victory. The first victories will be small, unheralded gym victories, seen by no one other than yourself. As those small victories accumulate they will be replaced by ever bigger victories until an unshakable faith in your ability walks within you and people call it confidence. Yes - in its mature form it is a mental attribute, but never forget that its infancy was physical.
