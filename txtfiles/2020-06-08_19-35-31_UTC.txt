Dominate the space between the knees: A fundamental premise of guard position is that THE TWO LEGS MUST WORK IN UNISON IF THE POSITION IS TO BE EFFECTIVE. If you can place the your body between his knees and prevent the legs from working together, you will have taken a big step towards shutting down your opponents guard. In addition, you will have placed yourself in a fine situation to pass. Look at Craig Jones wedging himself between the knees of his opponent in a way that totally shuts down the bottom athletes ability to use his legs in unison. Now he has shut down most forms of attack and resistance from the bottom player, he can focus on a choice between passing and leg lock attacks - and there is very little his opponent can do to stop either. Look for this situation whenever possible as you pass. You will find the other fellow canâ€™t attack with much, whilst you can attack with whatever you want.
