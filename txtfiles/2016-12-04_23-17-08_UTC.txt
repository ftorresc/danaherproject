Back in NYC: Great to be back in NYC - first stop - the blue basement of learning where the Ryan brothers are preparing for their big challenges on Dec 17 in San Diego against an extremely talented set of Brazilian athletes. Young Nicky Ryan, just fifteen years old, will take on world champion purple belt Kennedy Maciel, son of one of this generations greatest jiu jitsu practitioners, Ruben "Cobrinha" Charles. Mr Maciel is considerably older (19), bigger and more experienced than Mr Ryan, but Mr Ryan is training exceptionally well and is anxious to step up to the next level of competition. Normally I am very much against matching very young athletes against older athletes, but in this case I am willing to make an exception. Mr Maciel has a game of dynamic movement combined with isometric strength allied to superb technique - a combination that made his father one of the most successful competitors of all time. This will be a truly formidable opponent for Nicky Ryan. Mr Ryan is too young to have an adult belt in jiu jitsu and the youth belts don't really seem to apply to him - so I never gave  him a belt, but he does very well against experienced older belt levels in training and competition. Both Ryan boys are entering a phase of grappling maturity where they are starting to develop their own moves and tactics in ways that are truly exciting for me as a coach to observe - I am confident that that excitement will be seen in this match up of the two rising stars. The true camp begins tomorrow, so today we spent time setting directions and goals and light rolling. The squad will all return tomorrow  and then it's on and forward!!
