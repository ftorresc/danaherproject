In a tough match you might only get one shot at victoryâ€¦better to be damn good at a few moves than average at many. Nobody remembers the moves that ALMOST worked - they only remember the moves that DID work. You want enough diversity of moves to cover the whole body, but not so many that you never really master  any of them.
