If you can get an opponents hands to the floor whilst working from open guard - the attacks come easy: One of the surest signs that the bottom guard player is in command when working against a top passer is when he can consistently snap the top players hands down to the mat as a result of breaking his balance. While this not does score in itself, it is a great set up to score either with sweeps or submissions. Consistently look to snap your opponents hands down to the mat when working from open guard and then launch your attacks in the time between his hands hitting the mat and the time he can recover back to his stance. Here I have chosen cross ashi garami as the attack from open guard, but in truth, when you can get hands to the mat, you can attack with pretty much whatever you want!
