Any time, any place: The only constant in the life of a professional athlete is training. Often a busy competition schedule require extensive travel commitments. That does not mean training can be sacrificed. The athlete must be prepared to work out effectively in unfamiliar surroundings at whatever time is available with whomever is available and still get profitable work in. This requires planning and communication with the training partners you meet in location so that they become a temporary part of your program, rather than a challenge to be faced - there will be enough challenge out under the lights at the big show. Here, Garry Tonon gets good work in at Ralph Gracie's school in Northern California prior to a show. Ralph is brother to my teacher, Renzo Gracie - the family connection always makes for a welcome training location when possible.
