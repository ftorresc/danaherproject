When in doubt...Jiu Jitsu is a complicated sport with a requirement on your part to learn a lot of information - sometimes it’s a good thing to have one simple idea or directive to give direction to all that information - this can be worth its weight in gold in a stressful match situation where it’s unclear what the next move ought to be. In ashi garami based leg locks - that simple directive is always GET AS CLOSE TO YOUR OPPONENT AS YOU CAN AND STAY THERE UNTIL THE JOB IS DONE. The vast majority of your opponents defense will involves loosening the connection of your ashi garami and then pulling away to free the knee of his trapped leg. SO FOCUS ON GETTING AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN AS EARLY AS YOU CAN AND STAY THERE. Only when you stay true to this simple directive can you apply all the other stuff you need to demonstrate your growing leg lock mastery.
