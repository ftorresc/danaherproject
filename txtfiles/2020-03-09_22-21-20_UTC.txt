When you can pass guard you get to choose the battleground: The beauty of guard passing is that it enables you to put yourself in positions where your opponent cannot use his best weapons - his LEGS - to defend and attack from bottom position. It creates an immediate and devastating ASYMMETRY where you can attack at will whilst your opponent can only defend. A second great benefit is that you can now attack the whole body and choose where you want to to attack - legs, arms or neck. No other positional skill opens up so much variation in submission choice as guard passing - there is a reason why it is the centerpiece of the top positional game in Jiu Jitsu - make it the centerpiece of your game too!
