So proud of Nicky Ryan @nickyryanbjj who has just been announced as a starting athlete at the 2017 ADCC world championships under 66kg division after another athlete failed to make weight. Mr Ryan won bronze medals at both North American adcc trials and has now won the distinction of being the youngest ever competitor in the history of the event, having recently turned sixteen years old (he won bronze medals at trials at age fifteen). At a bodyweight of only 134 pounds he will not only be the youngest competitor but also by far the smallest. Here Mr Ryan orders a big dinner to try to beef up for the weekend ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚A jealous Garry Tonon let's him know how he feels about the youngster eating like a king while he can eat no more than salad ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Hats off to young Mr Ryan who has come such a long way in such a short time - representing his country after just two and half years of training and setting a record before he even steps on the mat ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
