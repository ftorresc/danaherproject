Nice match! In an unexpected turn of events at a local Grappling show in New Jersey, United Grapplers Association, in what was supposed to be an eight man tournament, most entrants pulled out, young Nicky Ryan, just fifteen years old, went in! He faced the great world champion, Paulo Miyao in a nice match, fought under ADCC rules. Mr Ryan was able to get to the legs for submission attempts, but could not establish the control necessary to make them effective. Mr Miyao did an excellent job of establishing positional control, using the threat of back attacks to pass Mr Ryan's legs and get to side and mount positions with a good controlling bodylock and score his points. The match ended in an uncontrolled ashi garami. A solid win for Mr Miyao and a great learning experience for the youngster. Mr Ryan did very well indeed, giving up a considerable amount of strength and size and a massive amount of experience - for a fifteen year to even survive against such a great champion is impressive, to get some attacks in and finish the match attacking to the last is deeply impressive. As this young man grows and matures it will be a privilege to watch he becomes capable of. Great to see famous champions such as Mr Miyao in local shows and showing their skills - a good day all round. ðŸ˜Š
