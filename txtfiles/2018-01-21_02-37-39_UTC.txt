A night at the boxing show with Mr Freddie Roach and his assistant Marie Spivey: Enjoying some boxing at Barclay center in Brooklyn NY. Always a pleasure to catch up with Mr Roach and listen to the fight wisdom that comes with decades in his craft at the very highest levels. Such a fascinating experience to hear his insight on boxing technique vs the demands of MMA. My privilege to watch great athletes up close through the lens of a truly great coach.
