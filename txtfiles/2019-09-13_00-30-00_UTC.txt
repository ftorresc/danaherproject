Know thyself: A big part of success both short term and long term comes from knowing your own game well. In the short term self knowledge helps you win today because you know what youâ€™re good and where you have weaknesses - so that when you take on a tough opponent you play mostly with what you do well and avoid what you do poorly. In the long term, self knowledge will direct your training regimen. By identifying your weaknesses you can devote extra training time to them with the goal of making your current weaknesses into future strengths. So whether for today or tomorrow - self knowledge is a critical part of your success. We all look in the mirror once a day to check our physical appearance - how often do you look in your Jiu Jitsu mirror and take a hard look at yourself - do it more often and do it with more care and you will be better equip for the challenges of today and the future.
