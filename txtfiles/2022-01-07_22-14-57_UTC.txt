Daylight: When it’s time to restrain an opponents movement you want to connect as tightly to him as possible. A simple test to assess the level of connection you’ve achieved is the daylight test. The more daylight you see between your limbs, torso and head - the weaker the connection between you and your opponent. When you want to shut down movement through connection, be sure to fit the shape of your body into that of your opponent so that there is very little daylight between you. If you can combine that level of connection with good positioning, you will be a very difficult opponent to shake off. This will require an interesting compromise between softness and hardness on your part. Your body will need to be soft enough to conform to the shape of your opponents body for connection without daylight, but hard enough to have sufficient muscular tension to stay connected to a strongly resisting opponent.
