The magic of angle: Understand this - any time you are engaged with an opponent, any defensive stance he takes is predicated on the current angle between him and you (usually you are directly in front of each other at the onset of engagement) - ANY CHANGE OF ANGLE ON YOUR PART RENDERS THE OPPONENTS DEFENSIVE STANCE NULL AND VOID. In short, CHANGE OF ANGLE CHANGES EVERYTHING. If you can move to a new angle - DOORS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY SHUT ARE SUDDENLY OPENED TO YOU - NOW is the time to attack!
