The other fellow: Many years ago I was in a UFC warm up room getting an athlete ready for competition. As the athletes get ready with exercises and drills they get their hands wrapped by the professionals. It’s fascinating watching a good hand wrapper go to work. They wrap with a precision that makes your hands feel like two steel encased weapons of war. As the wraps were being applied a young athlete was noisily expressing his approval and delight as his hands were encased in gauze and cotton. “Man! My hands feel like two bricks! Anything I hit I will go right through!” He stood up upon completion and smashed one hand into his other and growled as he felt the heavy power the wraps gave him. “I could punch a hole in the wall now! If I hit him with these - he’s sleeping!! I feel like a damn super hero!” The hand wrapper looked at him and quietly said, “very good - just remember that right now in another room your opponent is getting his hands wrapped the same way.” There was a quiet pause as the room reflected on the truth of those words. The athlete went silent and sat down with a reflective look of concern - the euphoria and confidence gone. Don’t put your confidence in things that your opponent has too. You may be strong - so is your opponent. You may be fast - so is your opponent. You may be confident - so is your opponent. Put your faith in the things that you can build to a degree that others don’t possess at your level - the things that training can create that separate you from others - your technique, tactics and preparation.
