When you have dangerous submission holds - even the ones that don’t fully work will have an impact on your opponent: A big part of how your opponent behaves towards you in a match is how DANGEROUS he perceives you to be. If he doesn’t see you as dangerous at all, he will do whatever he wants with no fear of consequences. However, if you have sharp submissions he will recognize that if he ever lets you go too far on a lock, the match is over. As a result, he will be much more circumspect in his approach to the match. If lock on a tight submission hold on a opponent that takes him within a hairbreadth of tapping but he just manages to slip out - I guarantee you the next time he approaches it will be in a cautious manner. It is important that you be able to carry a threat into a match that your opponent recognizes and respects - this will funnel his actions in other directions and allow you to control the direction of the ensuing action. In this way the THREAT of submissions is almost as important in match outcomes as the their actual successful APPLICATION. Here, Garry Tonon puts the powerful Rousimar Palhares under great pressure with a very strong heel hook attack - it was very close - but not completed - but it had a significant impact on the match as it meant Mr Tonon could initiate all the subsequent leg attacks for the rest of the match and force Mr Palhares in other directions (mostly takedowns). Don’t be discouraged by submissions that almost worked but didn’t - THEY WILL STILL HAVE AN EFFECT IN YOUR FAVOR THAT YOU CAN EXPLOIT ON THE PATH TO VICTORY
