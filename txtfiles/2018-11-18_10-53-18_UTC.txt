Catching up with old friends in the land of Oz: After a day of teaching big seminars for @kmamartialarts here in Sydney Australia I got a wonderful chance to catch up with two of my favorite colleagues, Greg Jackson and Carlos Machado who by chance were in town. So good to catch up and talk shop with these two and relive old stories and crazy times ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ Both men are an encyclopedia of knowledge and experience that is a privilege to have access to. Now I get ready for tomorrow at VT1 gym night seminar. Wishing you all the best from Sydney and hope this day took you just a little closer to your hopes and dreams in the sport #kaizenftw
