Getting ready for Austin Texas! Gordon Ryan, Garry Tonon and I are getting ready for a big move to Austin Texas to begin teaching and training. I will teach a seminar here in Puerto Rico to raise money for local Jiu jitsu schools who supported us in our time here - it will be sad to leave the Island but Iâ€™m excited for the future. Going to Texas was always fun adventure for competitions - now it will be to make a home! Initially we will teach out if a small local school Renzo Gracie Austin, but we will start scouting for our own place as we become more familiar with the city. The fun part will be re-learning how to drive! I have not driven a car since 1991! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ I will have to get a driverâ€™s license like a teenager and learn to handle a modern car! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ I am pretty sure I will end up in some kind of vehicular disaster in the first week! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ˜‚ Canâ€™t wait to get in the ground next week and start the journey to make Texas a Jiu jitsu powerhouse!
