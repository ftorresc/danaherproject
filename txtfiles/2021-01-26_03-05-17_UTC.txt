There is a direct correlation between how long you can stay on the back and the number of strangles you can score on the back: Submissions takes take time. Strangles from the back take even more time than usual. If you can’t maintain back position for a respectable amount of time it’s going to be very difficult to reliably finish from there. As such you have to develop your back riding ability as a skill in itself. Only when you can MAINTAIN the back position can you FINISH from the back position. Begin by seeing how long you can stay on a tough training partners back. Try to improve your times with every attempt. Train your eyes to SEE submission opportunities but don’t act on them until you’ve held the position as long as you aimed to do. Time spent training this way will pay big dividends when you have to go against an opponent with good defensive skills and where the finishes don’t come easy.
