A day to say goodbye: Today was the funeral for Big Gord. It was a day to remember the father who raised two strong grapplers, who gave what he had to see his sons pursue their dreams; who took greater pleasure in their successes than anything in his own life. He was a character who quietly suffered through great physical pains from more than twenty surgeries over his life and some private demons in his soul, but who nonetheless faced every dawn with resolve to help his family and friends any way he could. He was taken peacefully in his sleep secure in the knowledge that he was loved by those around him and that his sons had climbed to the top of their profession despite many disadvantages early in their lives. Tonight we will talk old stories and laugh and cry and then get set for a new day and a chance to give him more reason to be proud out into the future.
