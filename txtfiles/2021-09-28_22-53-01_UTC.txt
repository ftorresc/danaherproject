Creating a threat: How your opponent behaves towards you in a match is closely tied to whatever perceived threat level he believes about you. The higher his assessment of your threat level - the more conservative and reserved he will be in his actions around you - the less risks he will take as he engages with you. It is important therefore, that you take every opportunity to create attacking threats at all times during a match. Make sure that your defensive skills are closely followed by counterattack and that any indecision on his part is ruthlessly attacked by you. Positional threat is good, but submission threat usually creates a higher threat level, so make sure you have some favorite submission attacks for every scenario.
