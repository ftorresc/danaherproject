Ryan brothers back in action: Gordon Ryan is preparing for a tumultuous end to the year with three major engagements back to back. First he takes on Ralek Gracie in a submission only match in LA, then a very tough field in EBI 14 in Texas where he defends his open weight title, then Straight back to NYC to take on double ADCC gold medalist Yuri Simoes - a truly great champion in a weight division above his in the new Kasai event. Sixteen year old purple belt Nicky Ryan will take on 10th Planet adult black belt standout Ricky Lule, who in addition to being a fine jiu jitsu player, is also an excellent wrestler in what will be an exceptionally tough test for the gifted youngster. The match will take place in LA at Fight to Win pro (Eddie Cummings will be there to compete on the same night - more on that soon!) The squad will head to California on Thanksgiving Day in preparation for these big events and stay for a week. We are hoping to connect again with our Californian fans and show some interesting new directions in our training program. This was always my favorite photo of the Ryan brothers. It conveys well their focus and shared vision and experiences - attributes that have brought them both astounding progress in very little time. The only odd thing about the photo is a sinister Michael Myers impersonator lurking ominously in the background...
