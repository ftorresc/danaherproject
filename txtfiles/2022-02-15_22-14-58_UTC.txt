Quintessential Jiu jitsu moves: Do you think there are certain moves that represent the spirit of Jiu jitsu better than others? I’ve always believed that among the various submissions, the TRIANGLE and the REAR STRANGLE are more representative of the ideals of Jiu jitsu than the others. The rear strangle because it represents the Jiu jitsu ideal of ASYMMETRY IN ATTACKING POTENTIAL. A central theme of Jiu jitsu is to get to positions where you can attack your opponent at will, but he cannot attack you in return. Because the rear strangle is innately tied to dominant position, it is extremely difficult for an opponent even to defend himself, forget about attacking you. You on the other hand, can attack with the single most high percentage finishing hold in the sport - it doesn’t get any better than that. The triangle represents a different ideal of Jiu jitsu - the ideal of FIGHTING YOUR OPPONENTS UPPER BODY WITH YOUR LOWER BODY. The human body is set up in a way where the strength of our lower body is far greater than that of our upper body. If you want to be capable of beating bigger and stronger opponents, you must be able to grapple their upper body with your lower body - the triangle is among the finest examples of this in operation. I love all the major submissions of Jiu jitsu, but these two in particular stand out for their alignment with some of the most fundamental ideals of Jiu jitsu.
