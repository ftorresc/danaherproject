Worried about forward stacking pressure when youâ€™re going for your favorite submissions from bottom? Angle is your friend. Learn to RE-DIRECT forward stacking pressure by turning beyond perpendicular so that the forces of your submission hold COMPLIMENT your opponents stacking pressure rather than fight it. This will off balance your opponent and force him to either back off the pressure or get swept into an even worse situation. Make ANGLE a big part of your triangle and arm bar attacks from underneath and you will experience a lot more success from guard with your submission game!
