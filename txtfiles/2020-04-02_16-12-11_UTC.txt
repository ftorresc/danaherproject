Back in time: Here is an old clip from around 2005-6 featuring me teaching a young Georges St - Pierre the fine art of ashi garami entries from top position. I am contrasting traditional methods that focus upon ankle control and falling backwards away from an opponent, with an approach I often favor, focusing control on the area between the knee and hip and falling forwards into and across an opponent to set up strong heel hook and Achilles lock entries. This is an excellent application for MMA as legs often are used to defend against strikes and become quite vulnerable to a switch into leg locks. Itâ€™s a fun look back into the old days long before the squad, early GSP and of course...legendary haircuts...Apologies for horrendous video and sound quality - this was all long before the modern marvels of digital cameras and smart phones.
