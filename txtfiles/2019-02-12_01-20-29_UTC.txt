Heading to the Bronx to teach: Every Monday night for years now, I head up to the Bronx to teach at the school of my outstanding student Doug Pelinkovic at @bxmartialarts This weekend one of the Bronx students, Stanley Rosa, shocked everybody (except us ðŸ˜‰) by making a devastating run to the finals featuring his characteristic panther like movement and crushing submissions to take silver medal and show what a force he is. I love seeing this happen. He is raised at a local school and does 95% of his training with his classmates at that local school, but with passion and industry and knowledge he showed he can take on the best and prevail in style. There is both inspiration and a lesson in that for all of us. Canâ€™t wait to get to the Bronx and catch up with the whole crew and swap stories!
