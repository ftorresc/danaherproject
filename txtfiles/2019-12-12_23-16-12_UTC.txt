Mastery of the hook sweep (sumi gaeshi) - an essential part of my approach to the game: Very often I am approached by people who have visited the blue basement and they recount their training experiences to me. A very common theme that I hear many many times is this - “Man, I was expecting everyone to be good at leg attacks and back attacks and all the other submissions - but the one thing that really caught me by surprise was how easily and often everyone swept me from butterfly guard.” There is a reason for this. I PUT AN EXTREMELY HEAVY EMPHASIS ON EXCELLENCE WITH THE HOOK SWEEP (SUMI GAESHI) IN ALL ITS MANY VARIATIONS AS THE BASIS OF OUR BOTTOM OPEN GUARD GAME. No other sweep is performed as often and in so many forms in my coaching program. It is equally effective gi or no gi. It Can be used from any grip, in both left and right directions, standing or on the floor and creates defensive reactions that set up all our favorite entries into lower body and upper body submissions. Development of a strong sumi gaeshi game is one of the first signs I look for when assessing the progress of a developing students bottom  position skill level. All of my senior students excel in this move - no exceptions. There aren’t many moves that I tyrannically enforce upon my students, generally I liked to let them pick and choose their favorites past purple belt - but sumi gaeshi is one of them. Make sure you devote time to this classic and powerful move. It will benefit every aspect of your bottom game both position and submission.
