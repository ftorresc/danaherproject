Integration of offense and defense: Jiu jitsu and fighting in general is always divided into OFFENSIVE and DEFENSIVE skills. This is a useful division when you begin learning as it enables you to focus on a given skill domain. However, as you game matures letâ€™s be clear - your ultimate level in the game will not be measured so much by your skills in offense and defense but rather by your ability to INTEGRATE offensive and defensive skills. The final steps of the offense/defense dichotomy is to break down the barrier between them and see that ALL GOOD OFFENSE HAS DEFENSE BUILT INTO IT, AND ALL GOOD DEFENSE  HAS OFFENSE BUILT INTO IT. Your long term goal is to bring them together to the greatest degree possible at all times.
