Use the asymmetries of the human body in your favor: A fundamental asymmetry of the human body is that of the massively greater strength and endurance of our lower body over our upper body. Legs are far stronger than arms. Use this asymmetry to win - as much as possible FIGHT YOUR OPPONENTS UPPER BODY WITH YOUR LOWER BODY. This is one of the best ways for smaller, weaker people to defeat bigger, stronger people.  Juji gatame arm bars, triangles and omoplatas etc all do a great job of matching your leg strength against an opponents arm/shoulder/neck strength and as such, are among the best ways to take advantage of this fundamental feature of the human body. Actively look to employ it whenever you can - it is one of the key features of Jiu jitsu
