Garry Tonon gets in his last workout prior to @onechampionship in two days here in Manila. Tomorrow he will focus on the small weight cut. He is very small for 170 pound division - in the United States he would fight at 145, but the rules of One Championship forbid big dehydrating weight cuts. Now itâ€™s back to hotel for light meal and discussion. Wishing you all the best from Manila!
