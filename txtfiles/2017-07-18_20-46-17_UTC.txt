Seeing the old gang: It was my pleasure to trek out to Long Island NY to see Chris Weidman and Gian Valente prepare for their matches this weekend at his gym. Mr Weidman and Mr Valente worked out under the watchful eyes of Ray Longo and welterweight title challenger, Stephen Thompson. Coaching such a talented athlete will always be a highlight of my coaching career. When Mr Weidman opened his own gym his ability to come in to train in Manhattan was curtailed, but whenever he comes in it's a joy to watch his skills on the mat. He is looking very well prepared for what will be a very tough match indeed against the outstanding Kelvin Gastelum - the first time the UFC has ever been in Long Island. This is a great honor for Mr Weidman - I know he is intensely proud to headline a big show in his home town. Here he is relaxing after his last full power workout with Gian Valente, Ray Longo and Wonderboy Thompson , along with Wife Marivi and his charming children. It's impressive to watch the input of Mr Thompsons electrifying standing skills combined with the tactical sense of Mr Longo's direction. This will be a fascinating match up to be sure! Both fighters have evolved and come so far. I am heading out to Long Island now to run Mr Weidman through some grappling drills, an area he always excelled in ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
