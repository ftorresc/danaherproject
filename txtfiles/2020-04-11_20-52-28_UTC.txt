Learn to create multiple threats to break through tough defenses: The higher the skill level of your opponents, the harder it will become to finish them with even very strong single attacks. At some point you have to start creating multiple threats at the same time to force talented opponents to spread their defensive resources thin and make a final breakthrough possible. Look at how Gordon Ryan threatens with a Kimura grip that can also threaten a juji gatame arm bar and even a triangle entry of the hips can swivel around the torso, whilst also creating a positional attack via threat of points for attaining rear mount. Attacking in this matter puts an opponent under tremendous pressure and very few can stop it if applied for a good period of time. Once you become strong with a few single attacks, start exploring how you can link those attacks together - some fit together more naturally than others. Donâ€™t forget to add in lower body attacks - while you may have to move a little further the results can be outstanding.
