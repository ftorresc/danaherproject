Survive first - escape second: When you first begin Jiu jitsu is natural to feel totally intimidated by the power of your more experienced training partners attacks. Some days you feel that as soon as they get a good position on you, it’s all over. Start with the most modest, yet important Jiu jitsu goal - survival. Begin by seeing how long you can hold off submission attacks. Learn to tuck your him back in close to your torso and chin to chest. Learn to turn on your side rather than flat on your back so that you can bear weight more comfortably. Once survival seems attainable you can learn to relax a little - AS ANXIETY LEVELS FALL, YOUR CAPACITY TO THINK, REASON, RECALL INFORMATION AND SOLVE PROBLEMS WILL INCREASE - and that’s what will get you out of bad positions. Everything begins with survival skill that leads to mental calm. Mental calm begets sound decision making and sound decisions will create the routes you need to exit out of trouble. Make your first goals small. How much longer can you hold off a partner who usually finishes you in one minute from dominate position? If you can last two minutes you’re getting twice as good as before - that’s a small beginning, but most beginnings are small - in time they can lead to results that are huge.
