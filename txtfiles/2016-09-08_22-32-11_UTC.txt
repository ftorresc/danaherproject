Last NYC training sessions: Gordon Ryan trains with brother Nicky and Garry Tonon works with Oliver Taza during the final build up to EBI 8 this weekend in LA. Here we work positional pressure drills, critical for creating the conditions where submissions will become available. They provide a great deal of intensity to simulate matches, but with greater safety for the athletes as the competition gets close and injury can be a real problem. EBI 8 will showcase many very talented athletes - some of whom have given Mr Ryan real trouble in the past. As such they will provide an excellent measure of his relative progress since the time they last met and also of the training program overall.
