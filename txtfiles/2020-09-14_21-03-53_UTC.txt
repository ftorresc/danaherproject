Plotting: one of the great things about grappling martial arts is they often offer you good opportunities to SLOW THINGS DOWN and to THINK ABOUT YOUR NEXT MOVE. In striking martial arts there is usually a much higher pace and very little time to think once you get within striking range. In Jiu jitsu, all the dominant pin positions, rear mount, mount, side and north/south, along with top turtle position, half guard top and bottom and closed guard, enable you to take a breather and consider your next line of attack. Learn to use these positions as more than physical advantage, but also as a means to gain TACTICAL ADVANTAGE through the use of plotting a next move. Here, Gordon Ryan has worked himself to top turtle position - a good one for taking some time to consider the next options
