Getting ready for the big show: Last workout complete. The squad relaxes after the last hard workout in NYC. Now it's travel time and some light work before the big show in Sunday night. Garry Tonon looks to have fallen still further into insanity, whilst Oliver Taza appears to have regressed back into a lost childhood. Thankfully Gordon Ryan appears somewhat normal - hope he can pull it off long enough to get on a plane and get to LA ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
