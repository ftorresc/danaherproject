Calm under pressure: One of the most crucial attributes of good competitors is the ability to maintain calm under pressure. The ability to solve problems as they arise during the match is absolutely crucial to victory. Your ability to solve problems is directly related to your ability to maintain as calm a mind as possible as you work. If you look at the faces of elite athletes in all sports as they engage in tough competition, it is surprising how calm and composed they look despite the immense pressure they are under. Here Ethan Crelinsten works hard against teammate Frank Rosenthal - both men showed excellent use of leg locks and back attacks at the recent Finishers Sub Only tournament and fought a pitched battle in the final. You can practically see their minds working to solve problems as they battle for control. This kind of internal control over our own mind and demeanor is a prerequisite of control over an opponent's body. It must be developed in the gym like any other skill - you will need it in competition outside the gym
