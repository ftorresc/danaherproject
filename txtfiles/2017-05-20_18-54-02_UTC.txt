Extended families: One of the great things about jiu jitsu is the brotherhood created by shared teachers and students. One of my great mentors as a beginner in the sport was world champion, Matt Serra. His student, Jason Rau, trains a lot with the squad. He arrived with his teachers strong positional game and quickly began to pick up the submissions game training with us. Today he won The Grappling Industries Open weight event (Jason is a welterweight) all four matches by submission. Here he is submitting Todd Muckenheim in the final via heel hook variation. He does a great job of staying on the leg throughout determined resistance and getting his submission. It's a fine example of an athlete adding to an already strong game to push himself in new directions and get good results.
