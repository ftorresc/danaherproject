Hmmm...I wonder what the next move will be? When you slap hands with your training partner at the onset of a match in Jiu jitsu you both have an almost limitless number of possible options as far as technique and tactics are concerned. The goal is to take your opponent down a path where his options are rapid taken from unlimited to two or three easily identifiable options. WHEN YOU CAN STRONGLY LIMIT YOUR OPPONENTS AVAILABLE OPTIONS HE BECOMES PREDICTABLE - AND A PREDICTABLE OPPONENT IS MUCH EASIER TO DEFEAT. This is done by locking your opponent into a grip and position from there are only a couple of ways to extricate himself. Experience will tell you what these options are. When you can quickly impose a grip or hold upon an opponent that leaves him with a decision tree with only two three branches - you are on the short cut to victory.
