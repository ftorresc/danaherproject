Filming the ENTER THE SYSTEM: TRIANGLES instructional video: Just finished filming the next installment of the ENTER THE SYSTEM instructional video series featuring the triangle system that has been used so successfully by my students in competition. I have always had a special affinity for the triangle and believe it plays a tremendous role in athlete development not just as a submission hold but also as one of the best ways to get athletes used to attacking with their legs - a core characteristic of good Jiu Jitsu. Here we are playing around with triangle attacks against a seated guard - I have not done this move since my hip replacement so this was a fun experiment ðŸ˜‚. Now Iâ€™m on the train back to NYC - arriving at 2:30am and then back to training in the blue basement early in the morning ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ Wishing you all the best
