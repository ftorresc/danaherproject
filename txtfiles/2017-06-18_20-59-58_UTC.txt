The return of the Wolverine: We are very excited to see the return of Eddie Cummings to top level grappling competition in the near future with a tremendous match up at Grappling Industries NYC event August 19th in Manhattan against the great Paulo Miyao. The squad has faced the Miyao brothers before, When Garry Tonon took on Joao Miyao and took a hard contested win. In that encounter, however, the rule set was one unfamiliar to the Miyaos. This time it will be a rule set they know very well and have excelled in - ADCC rules. It is natural for most people to see this as a match of a positional master against a submission master. Whilst it is true that one tends to win more by position and the other by submission, both are extremely talented in both domains. Mr Cummings has guard retention skills that are second to none and is also a very fine guard passer. He has been training hard and pushing his skill set and looking for new directions in training and preparation - I am certain you will see a very well prepared Mr Cummings step on to the mat August 19th. Great to see two truly top level grapplers showcase their skills in NYC!
