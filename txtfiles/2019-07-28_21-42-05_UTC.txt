Aussie Invasion: The squad is in preparation for ADCC 2019 and a big part of the team is our Australian friends spearheaded by @craigjonesbjj  @izaakmichellbjj and @ethanthomasmma Though I was born in the United States, I was raised in New Zealand and my family lives in Australia - one of my regrets in life is that I was never in a position to help grappling as much in Australasia as I was here - so having these Aussies here in the basement full time is a great way to atone for this ğŸ¤—ğŸ˜œğŸ¤— Here they after a great day of training - a true cast of characters who represent Australiaâ€™s incredible sports heritage in the world of grappling. ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡º
