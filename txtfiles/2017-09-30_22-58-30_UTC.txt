Reducing intensity - increasing effectiveness: When preparing for a major competition, the intensity of the training sessions must be correlated with the time remaining before the event. Our camp for ADCC 2017 put a heavy emphasis on standing grappling/takedowns (tachi- waza) which is typically more physically demanding than ne waza (ground grappling ). In the final week in Finland prior to the event, I eliminated live standing grappling from the workout and focused entirely upon drilling and limited ne waza sparring. This was to give the athletes a chance to physically recover from a grueling two and half month camp that had severely tested their bodies and to reduce the likelihood of last minute injuries. In the final days it is very unlikely that any additional training will improve performance - there simply is not enough time to adopt new techniques. Instead the focus is upon coming in healthy and rested. Here, Gordon Ryan and Oliver Taza go through ashi garami drills three days before they got to use them so effectively on the big stage at the world championships. Learning to vary the intensity of workouts is a big part getting athletes to peak at the right time. For those who are not actively competing, it is still a crucial concept. Varying workout intensity is a fine way increasing longevity in the sport by decreasing physical demands on days when your body is not ready for high output. Not every day needs to be maximal effort. I would rather see an athlete consistently workout seven days a week with big variations in intensity than say, twice a week at maximum intensity over the course of a year. Just as we donâ€™t try to live every day of our lives at maximum intensity but rather follow a pattern of easy days with intense days interspersed among them, so too, we ought to act similarly with our workouts.
