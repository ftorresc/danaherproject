Great day of work today at BJJ Fanatics in Boston: I took the train back to Boston to film the next installment of the ENTER THE SYSTEM series - this time itâ€™s KIMURA ATTACKS! It was a pleasure meeting @nicholasmeregali this outstanding young athlete has astounded the jiu jitsu world with his skill and competitive fire - he is also a great character! Today I worked with @matheusgonzagabjj who was and exceptionally good demonstration partner and @bernardofariabjj and @michaelzenga We start work again tomorrow morning to get this project done!
