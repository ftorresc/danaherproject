Changing the instructional video game: Dinner with the great Bernardo Faria and Michael Zenga of BJJ Fanatics. We have some fascinating projects coming up - technique in jiu jitsu changes every year, but TEACHING METHODOLOGY has been largely static for generations- we aim to change that! Big plans for the future - canâ€™t wait to share with you all! Wishing you all the best from NYC!
