Three milestone UFC's: whatever complaints people may voice about the UFC, it remains the longest running, most prestigious, most financially successful, most recognizable MMA organization among a sea of failed competitors. UFC 1 was the shot heard around the martial arts world that started a revolution. It transformed overnight the publics ideas of what real fighting would be like. UFC 100 was the biggest event in UFC history, with superstars like Brock Lesnar and Georges St-Pierre and the then unknown, Jon Jones. Mr St-Pierre fought the outstanding kick boxer Tiago Alves that night. It was truly a coaching highlight for me. I was privileged to be among the top MMA talent in the world - a who's who of fighting all stars from every era of the sport and to see Mr St-Pierre put on a flawless display to win a decisive victory from cage side. By UFC 100 the sport has matured greatly from its primitive beginnings and Mr St-Pierre epitomized the modern professional fighter in a sport exploding in popularity. Now we are in the eve of another milestone for the sport and the organization. UFC 200 represents new improvements in drug testing. Earlier UFC's had only the most rudimentary testing. Mr St-Pierre's stand against drug use and retirement over the issue prompted much discussion and change. Now the testing system, whilst far from perfect, is considerably better than previous milestone UFC's. This is a healthy direction for the sport. Here's to UFC 200 - I hope one day I watch a UFC 1000 and marvel at the positive changes since those crazy early days ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
