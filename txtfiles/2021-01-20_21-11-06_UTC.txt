Every Jiu jitsu athlete try’s to create problems for their opponent. That’s good. If you can CREATE problems faster and more imaginatively than your opponent can SOLVE them you will eventually win. But better yet is to go beyond creating PROBLEMS and create DILEMMAS. These have no solution - only a choice between two bad outcomes. When you can put opponents into dilemmas your opponent will avoid one option and will win on the other horn of the dilemma. Here Gordon Ryan demonstrates it perfectly with a front triangle combined with armbar. If his opponent stacks forward to avoid the armbar he will be strangled by the triangle. If he postures up and away from the strangle he will expose his arm to the arm bar. Whichever choice makes he will be submitted. That is the highest kind of Jiu jitsu.
