You aren’t going to be the hammer every time - spend some practicing to be the nail: Jiu Jitsu is a sport with two main elements - OFFENSE and DEFENSE. Only by practicing BOTH will you reach your potential in the sport. Of course practicing offense is a lot more fun, but the fun ends abruptly when you run into a tough opponent who puts you in a defensive situation and you realize you haven’t trained for this at all and you don’t have the skills to hold him off. Set time every session to practice the crucial skill of defense. This sport is full of can crushers who look amazing going against easy opponents but who fold badly against studs. Only by regularly training the less pleasant aspects of the sport do you get the rare and wonderful ability to survive a bad situation against a talented opponent and fight back to victory.
