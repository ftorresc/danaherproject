Push and pull: If you wish to excel in Jiu jitsu there is one seemingly simple edict upon which much of your future success or failure depends - when an opponent pulls - push - and when he pushes - pull. It’s a simple and well known idea that people TALK about all the time and then forget as soon as they start sparring. Don’t just SAY it - LIVE AND BREATH IT every time you’re on the mat and I promise you that your performance will increase overnight. When you have a strongly resisting opponent this fundamental maxim will help your performance more than anyone technique will. Learn to take advantage of the power of your opponents force and you will make a strong man fight HIS OWN STRENGTH as well as yours!
