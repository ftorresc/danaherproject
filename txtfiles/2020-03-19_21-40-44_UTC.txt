Ever try to untie complex knot under pressure? Did getting emotional or hyped up or excited help you untie the knot? No - it never does. Jiu Jitsu is the task of untying many complex knots in a sequence under great pressure as an opponent is trying to tie you in knots - getting emotional isnâ€™t going to help you there either. You will be amazed how much better you perform just by keeping a calm mind and a cold heart as other people get emotional around you. The best problem solvers know that a calm mind and spirit solves problems better than an emotionally fraught one. No matter how much one part of your mind screams at you - the conscious decision making part of your mind should stay calm - only then will you get the results that bring out the excitement!
