Sad to hear my friend Chris Weidman is injured and out of his rematch with Luke Rockhold. Our lives swing endlessly from highs to lows, often in response to events outside our control. The one thing we can control is our response to those events. Keep focused on your goals and try hard not to be distracted by the disappointments and sorrows of the current day, but lifted by the vision of a better tomorrow. Have the confidence of a man who knows that if he has climbed a mountain before, he knows he has it in him to do it again.
