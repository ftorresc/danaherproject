Squad hangs out with Sensei after class: Training is always tough - it’s always great to have someone light up the room after a tough session. No one does it better than my dear sensei, Renzo Gracie! Great to see Georges St-Pierre get the latest grappling material under his belt with the squad. Garry Tonon is working hard in preparation for his next MMA bout - who better to get advice and tips from than Georges St-Pierre? It’s the exchange of expertise that helps make this place so special. Another tough but fun day in the blue basement!
