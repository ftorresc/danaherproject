All alone in a crowded room: most of our Jiu jitsu lives are lives in a community of friends and teammates, coaches and mentors. You can have great support behind you to help in preparation, but at the end of the day - you walk out on the mat alone. In your own time, focus on building the inner confidence to let all the work you did with your friends in preparation shine when youâ€™re out there all alone. Managing the separation of communal training with the aloneness of competition is a big part of dealing with your toughest matches
