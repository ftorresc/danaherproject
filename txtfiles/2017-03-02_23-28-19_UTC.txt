Fireworks: There is no bigger show than the UFC and this weekends UFC looks like it will be a great event. Two of my favorite divisions, welterweight and lightweight will get some much needed clarity and closure after recent disorder. The majority draw in the first match between Tyron Woodley and Steven Thompson prevented Demian Maia from getting his much deserved title shot, but hopefully now we shall get a positive result and the welterweight division can move forward. Georges St-Pierre always told me Mr Thompson was the best standing striker he ever saw or worked with, but Mr Woodley did extremely well with him in the standing position in the first fight. Both men can hit well from extreme distances, covering vast amounts of ground to land blows - one with crushing one punch KO power, the other with stunning accuracy and timing. The bout I am most interested in is at light weight. I have always been extremely impressed by Khabib Nurmamogedov. His takedown and ground control skills are of the highest level. Several people I know in the industry whose word I trust have told me numerous stories of Mr Nurmamogedov dominating very highly ranked athletes in weight divisions above his own. He has a smothering control that makes his opponents look powerless in comparison. On the other hand, his opponent, Tony Ferguson has a fascinating style based around scrambles and  devastating attacks as he directs those scrambles in ways that few opponents can keep up with. One fighter is a master of control - the other is a master of chaos- this is going to be very interesting indeed!
