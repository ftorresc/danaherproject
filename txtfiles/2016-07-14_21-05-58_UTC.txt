The subtleties of ashi garami: Whenever you attempt ashi garami, there will inevitably be some degree of exposure of your feet and legs to your opponents counters. This unavoidable fact must be factored into your plans as you launch your attacks. Sound knowledge of the many subtleties of foot and leg positioning is essential if you are to avoid being strongly countered as you attempt your own locks. A fascinating example of this occurred in what was probably the greatest leg lock battle of all time between leg locking maestros Garry Tonon and Rousimar Palhares. Mr Tonon shocked many by initiating all the leg locks in the match on the much larger and universally feared Mr Palhares. In characteristic style, Mr Palhares aggressively countered with his own locks. The crowd gasped as both men went hard for the break. Most people in the audience expected Mr Palhares to prevail due to his size and reputation as a leg breaker. Yet it was he who had to break away first. Mr Tonon did a fine job of positioning his feet in a manner that gave him mechanical advantage in this ferocious leg lock shoot out. Every jiu jitsu student must have faith in the idea that Mechanical advantage will prevail over size and aggression - this is the proposition upon which our entire sport is based - Mr Tonon showed his faith that night. Interestingly, as the match progressed, Mr Palhares stopped trying to counter leg lock and went straight to escape as a safety measure - such was the precision and effectiveness of Mr Tonon's leg attacks on his opponent. Here the two men go for their respective locks early in the match.
