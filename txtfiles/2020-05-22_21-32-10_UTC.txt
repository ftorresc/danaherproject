YOU! Yes you...that was the worst arm bar in the  entire history of arm bars...you could go back in a time machine to feudal Japan and observe in fast forward all the arm bars performed since the thirteenth century and you would not see a more feeble attempt at an arm bar than that one! You couldnâ€™t arm bar a sleeping, drunk one armed man with that miserable technique! #positivereinforcementFTW
