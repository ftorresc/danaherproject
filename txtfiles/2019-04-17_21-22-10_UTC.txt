The return of the boxing master!! Wonderful seeing my friend and cornering comrade, the inestimable Freddie Roach along with his hard working assistant Marie at RGA today!! Mr Roach is in town for Boxing at Madison Square Garden this weekend and stopped by to say hello. What a treasure this fellow is. He looks in the best shape I have seen him in years!! He came dancing down the basement stairs like a shadow boxing workout! Tonight we will go out with Georges St - Pierre and talk old days and technique ðŸ˜œðŸ¤— There is nothing better than a conversation with a person who is a master of their craft - tonight I get to talk with two!
