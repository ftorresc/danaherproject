The kohai shine in Texas: Fast rising squad kohai (little brothers) Ethan Crelinsten and Oliver Taza took center stage at the Texas Jiu Jitsu Kumite professional grappling tournament yesterday. Both won their respective weight divisions all by submission under EBI rules. Both hail from Canada but train with the squad and have done a fine job of absorbing our methods and philosophy. They have a special place in my heart as they make the same trip from Montreal to train with us in NYC that Georges St-Pierre Made as a young man to become champion - I believe they will do likewise one day in grappling. They spend at least two weeks of every month in NYC and make real sacrifices to get to their goals. Mr Crelinsten has made astonishing progress in technical depth and his repertoire of submissions is already impressive. Mr Taza brings a quiet intensity to both training and competition and has an artistry to his dangerous submission game that is a pleasure to behold. Keep your eye on these youngsters - they have the ambition and the work ethic to go all the way to the top. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š Good to see them displaying their medals and counting their shekels as reward for their hard work! A fantastic first day for the squad in 2017 with Gordon Ryan winning Sapeteiro 6, Mathew Tesla taking second in a brilliant debut performance, Shy Ace winning his superfight at the same event by submission, Mr Taza and Mr Crelinsten wining In Texas and other kohai putting on great performances at the same event. Renzo and I are so proud of you  and all the students at RGA who help you prepare ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
