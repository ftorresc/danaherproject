Downtown ninja: First Bane - now NINJAâ€™S!! WTF!! Going for a solo stroll around a very quiet downtown Manhattan - I always knew growing up in the 80â€™s watching ninja movies would pay off one day!! Normally if you walked around Manhattan like this youâ€™d get arrested; but in these strange times youâ€™d get arrested for NOT dressing this way! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ You know me - Always setting the latest fashion trends. Hope you are all well!
