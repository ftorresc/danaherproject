Heading out: You can have as many coaches and training partners as you want around you; all your friends and family, thousands of cheering fans, in some cases a whole nation - but in the end ONLY ONE THING COMES WITH YOU INTO THE CAGE OR ON TO THE MAT - YOUR PREPARATION. In those lonely few moments before your name is called and the arena roars there is no lying to yourself. If your preparation was thorough it will lift your spirits and buoy your confidence; if not, whatever fears and doubts you have will be amplified tenfold. In training, whenever your spirit is diffuse and motivation lacking - picture yourself heading out to the arena. Understand that every forward step in training, no matter how tiresome, repetitive, boring, will be part of a shield against the fears and doubts your future self will feel when your name is called.
