Fixation: Probably one of the surest ways to hinder performance is to select a given move and push hard to complete it LONG AFTER THE OPPORTUNITY FOR IT HAS PASSED. So often in a sparring session or match we develop a tunnel vision that limits our outlook to an extent where it harms performance. A MAN WITH A THOUSAND TECHNIQUES CAN BE REDUCED TO A ONE TRICK PONY IF HE SEES ONLY POSSIBILITY IN FRONT OF HIM. One of the most valuable services a coach can provide is an extra set of eyes that widen the scope of an athletes vision and alert him to other choices that can open up the action and create forward direction. The odd thing is that tunnel vision arises from a desirable origin in athletes - focus. Athletes need focus to direct them to and through the application of a given technique. However, applied too long, the virtue of focus becomes the vice of tunnel vision, as the athlete stays with one move when probability of it succeeding has become unacceptably low. Here I am calling out options for Gordon Ryan on his way to a perfect victory at EBI 11 - that night he did not need it, he found by himself the perfect compromise between focus and adaptation - a hallmark of good jiu jitsu
