The kohai step up at American ADCC trials: An extremely impressive day for the squad kohai (juniors) at the west coast ADCC trials today. Our Canadian squad members had a very fine day indeed with Ethan Crelinsten winning gold at 66kg and a ticket to the world championships in Finland. Oliver Taza got to the semi finals. Nicky Ryan put in another incredible performance as this fifteen year old prodigy submitted his opponents all the way to semi finals where he lost narrowly on points to team mate Mr Crelinsten (who went on to get gold). He finished with a bronze medal - more importantly he finished with the realization that at such a young age he can easily mix it up with the adults at national level and get to the top ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠMatthew Tesla submitted his opponents before dropping a match on points to team mate Oliver Taza. We are so proud of these young men and their achievements and more importantly, the preparation and lifestyle they instill in themselves to make such achievements possible.
