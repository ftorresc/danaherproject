Back attacks: The human body is set up well to deal with threats from the front, but does not cope well with threats from an angle. The best angle of them all from which to attack is directly behind an opponent. From here the attacker has considerable mechanical and tactical advantages that should enable him to prevail in most cases, other things being equal. One of the most important skills to develop then, is the ability to work your way behind your opponent and stay there long enough with sufficient control to do damage or finish the match. Jiu jitsu shows its fighting pedigree in awarding maximum points for getting to an opponent's back - in recognition of this fundamental fact about it's value in unarmed human combat. Interestingly, many other grappling arts, such as Judo and most wrestling styles, do not award points at all, or award relatively minor points, for attaining this most dominant of grappling positions. Here Georges St-Pierre works on his back attacks prior to his bout with the formidable Nick Diaz - a skill he used extensively to dominate the action in that memorable fight.
