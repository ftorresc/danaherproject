I am very happy to announce the launch today of my latest instructional video series FEET TO FLOOR Volume 2. The emphasis of Volume 1 was on getting students with little standing experience to a level where they could takedown opponents their own size and skill level in the shortest possible time frame. This was done by focusing on the crucial preliminary skills that make all the other standing skills possible - stance, motion, grip, off balancing and position. Then we looked at the takedowns that most people find the fastest to acquire skills in - the hand dominant takedowns suck as collar drags, ankle picks, single legs, double legs etc along with a section on takedowns for self defense. This time we look at the longer term skill of takedowns that are foot/leg dominant along with the takedowns that I believe are the best suited overall for most Jiu jitsu purposes - the sacrifice takedowns (sutemi waza) such as Tomoe nage, sumi gaeshi and uki waza. These combine extreme effectiveness with great tactical safety and have a lot of cross over with skills that Jiu jitsu athletes are already very familiar with in ground training - so they are relatively easy for most students to learn. The big theme of the video is to get you all thinking like a boxer - just as a good boxer sees the jab as his most important punch - not because of its hitting effect, but because of its ability to harass, distract, confuse an opponent in ways that set up the powerful following punches - so too, a good grappler uses his feet to sweep, trip and off balance an opponent to harass, stumble and confuse an opponent to set up the big follow up throws - in this case, Tomoe nage, sumi gaeshi and uki waza (bit also any other throws you favor) If you want to make your feet your jab and set up power throws perfectly  suited to JiuJitsu and get some highlight reel scores - take a look ðŸ˜œ There is a link in my Instagram bio
