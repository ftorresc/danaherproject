The magic of ashi garami: Most people associate the use of ashi garami by my students as a leg locking position, but never forget that it is equally useful as a sweeping position from bottom and a passing position from top. Only when you start to use the POSITIONAL function of ashi garami will you be able to maximize or SUBMISSION potential. Here, Gordon Ryan sends a man tumbling to the mat with a standard form of ashi garami - this will immediately create a dual positional and submission threat. He can attack the legs or get up on top with his own legs in the perfect position to begin passing pressure. As much as you may enjoy leg locking out of ashi garami - donâ€™t neglect your positional attacks from this incredible hold!
