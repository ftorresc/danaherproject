New guys in town: Squad standouts Garry Tonon and Oliver Taza get a great workout in at a local school here in London #10thplanetlondon. It was fun making the switch back to pure submission grappling training rather than the more positional work we have been doing lately in preparation for adcc world championships. It's always nice to workout in a new room and work under a different vibe and atmosphere. Now time to get back to hotel shower and get dinner - more of the same tomorrow! Two days of fine tuning and then the big show at O2 Arena London!
