Victory in New York City: Gordon Ryan capped off an incredible year in NYC tonight, defeating multi world champion and two time ADCC gold medalist Yuri Simoes by submission with just seconds left on the clock after a dominant display of reversals and guard passing pressure. This has been an amazing three weeks for Mr Ryan. In a three spree he defeated Ralek Gracie, won EBI 14 and defeated a two time ADCC champion in a weight division above him. Garry Tonon competed in the tournament and had some memorable moments in his characteristic style but did not want to play the point game that is required to win the format. Young gun Nick Ronan had a fine performance in the preliminaries- putting on a submission clinic on opponent Mike Davila culminating in a fine strangle from the back. It was great to be able to represent our style in our home town in Kasai grapplingâ€™s inaugural show. Hope you all enjoyed the event!
