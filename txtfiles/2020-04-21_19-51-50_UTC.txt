Two approaches to leg locking: When it’s time to attack the legs there are two main methods. The first is to get to the finishing position as soon as possible so that it is set before an opponent can  gather up an effective defense. The second is to exert sufficient control over an opponents hips that they cannot move defensively. This enables you to pin them for extended periods of time in leg locking positions and work your way patiently to the finishing position and completion. Both methods are very successful. If you choose the second method a big part of your success or failure will come from a principle of control I call “double trouble.” When an opponent goes to escape any given ashi garami based leg lock, the overwhelming majority of the defensive issues are caused by their other leg (the one you aren’t locking) - if you can control THAT leg as well as the one you intend to break - you double the difficulty of escape for your opponent. Here, Gordon Ryan makes use of double trouble to secure a knee bar finish. Look for many ways to employ this important principle in your lower body attacks, whether it be leg locks, takedowns, sweeps - it will make you much more successful on the mats
