If you understand exactly what the main underlying body movement patterns of Jiu Jitsu are - you can shut them down - and if you can shut down the MOVEMENTS, then you can shut down the MOVES. The vast majority of the moves from bottom position, everything from pin escapes, guard retention, sweeps etc etc all involve the body movement of SHRIMPING (in its various manifestations). It stands to reason then, that if you study exactly what is required to shrimp your body, then you will know exactly what it is required to shut it down; and if you can shut down shrimping, you will have shut down any move from bottom position that is reliant upon shrimping to work. Shrimping always has three key elements. A planted foot, a moving hip and a moving head. If you can subvert any of those three elements, you can shut down the movement overall and any subsequent moves that were based on it. This is why I put a heavy emphasis upon learning the underlying solo body movements of Jiu Jitsu - not as a boring and fruitless warm up before class - but as a specialized study in its own right. Understand the movements and you can grasp how to shut them down. Shut down the movement and this shut down an opponents moves. Here, Nicky Rod does a good job stopping a shrimping movement at the head and hips to prevent any effective defense to his passing attack.
