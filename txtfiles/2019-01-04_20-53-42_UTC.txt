@garrytonon gets his Shoot Boxing (striking integrated with takedowns) rounds in today. It is always a fascinating thing to watch the skills of grappling mixed in with the skills of striking. Throughout history the vast majority of martial arts have fallen into one of two main camps - striking or grappling - yet nothing is more exciting, nothing is more effective and nothing is more illuminating than the mix of both together. Thank you to @sanabul for the excellent training gear worn by sparring partner @drewhooper_mma
