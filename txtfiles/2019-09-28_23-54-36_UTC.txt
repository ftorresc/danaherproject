Strong first day for the squad at the ADCC World Championships: In Jiu Jitsu as in life, no one cares how you start - they only care about how you finish - thatâ€™s why we donâ€™t put too much emphasis on the first dayâ€™s results - nonetheless it was a strong start for the squad on Day One with four out of five athletes through to the semi finals. There were some incredible matches today that I am sure will have people talking for quite a while. We are all heading back to prepare for a big day tomorrow. As always thank you so much for your support and following our athletes and our philosophies. Hope you all enjoyed the show! Back in action tomorrow ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ
