Squad senior and widely regarded as the worlds most exciting grappler, Garry Tonon @garrytonon is back in action this weekend against the great champion Osvaldo Queixinho Moizinho at @f2wbjj in Dallas Texas. Mr Moizinho has himself a very exciting and dynamic style of Jiu jitsu that won him multiple no gi world championships. He is a master of juji gatame arm bar and omoplata attacks which he can get from almost anywhere. With these two submission wizards in stage this should be a great match!
