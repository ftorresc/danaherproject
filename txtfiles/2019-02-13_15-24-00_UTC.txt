Gordon Ryan guard passing video release today!! BJJ Fanatics will release the the best No Gi guard passing instructional ever made today. Gordon Ryan has meticulously put together our approach to No Gi guard passing featuring all of his own innovative additions and special tweaks that he has used to dominate his opponents guards at the highest levels of competition. Passing guard in the blue basement, where everyone is a dangerous leg locker, requires that in addition to being able to pass, you must also be able to shut down leg attacks at the same time. Also, much of our grappling training is grappling for MMA, where there is a constant danger of opponents standing up on you as you attempt to pass, so a big part of our focus is on guard passing methods that ensure an opponent is kept down as we go to work. Also, we began our journey in submission only tournaments where guard passing scores nothing - so we had to create many submission attacks as we passed and play a dilemma game based around the dual threat of passes and submission. Mr Ryanâ€™s video reflects these four demands. He has created a passing method that
1 - Will get you passing the guards of all your peers in record time
2 - will shut down leg lock dangers as you do it
3 - will make it exceedingly difficult for opponents to stand up as you do it
4 - will make you a dangerous passer who can simultaneously create submission threats as you pass. 
Check out this game changing instructional video to see how the best gets it done - soon you will too! ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ Link to BBJ Fanatics website in my Instagram story
