I am very happy to announce the release of the first instructional video of the NEW WAVE JIU JITSU series A NEW PHILOSOPHY OF POSITIONAL ESCAPES which focus on the escape skills that enable my students to attack with total confidence - knowing that if their attacks ever compromise their position they can easily escape and get right back into attack. Many people were shocked to see how squad stars like Garry Tonon and Gordon Ryan escaped easily from the best attacking positions in Jiu Jitsu to dominate EBI Overtime in competition even against much larger and more experienced opponents. In addition I show my maximizing approach to escape, which strongly emphasizes immediate submission counter attack after escape as one of the best ways to increase your submission percentages and keep the momentum in your favor at all times.
