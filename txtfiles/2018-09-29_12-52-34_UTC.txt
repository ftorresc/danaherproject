Juniors on fire at Rise Grappling Invitational! Last night the squad juniors put on an amazing team display at the growing Rise grappling show in New York. First up was leg locking ace Robert Degle who blitzed his opponent in ten seconds via heel hook. Newly promoted black belt Frank Rosenthal clearly took that as a challenge - he took on an athlete that flograppling ranks number five in the world no gi and heel hooked him in less than ten seconds! Then Ryan Quinn stepped up to win the 185 pound tournament. Nick Ronan had a tough physical match with a Pan Am brown belt double champion and won a thriller in overtime using back system to get the strangle for the win! In the main event Jason Rau took took on the outstanding Mansher Munch Khera and showed his leg locking mastery with several beautiful entries into the legs along with bottom sweep attempts that took him to a tightly contested judges decision win! Before all that, young Trinity Pun, just thirteen years old, showed her skill and tenacity to take a hard fought draw - big future there!  Gordon Ryan did great work as cornerman along with my mentor Matt Serra, where Mr Ronan and Mr Rau began jiu jitsu and still teach and train. Great stuff from these outstanding athletes! Always so proud of their development and growth and the story that all of you must write - of someone following their passion and crafting a plan to get there and showing the discipline to stay the course. Well done! ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤— Legs and back system FTW!
