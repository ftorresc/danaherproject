Old school and new school: It was a fun day training at RGA in NYC today. In the afternoon class, squad standouts Eddie Cummings, Garry Tonon, Ethan Crelinsten and Jake Shields worked hard to prepare for upcoming matches (more on that soon ðŸ˜Š) Then afterwards, one of the original RGA senpai, Matt Serra came in to say hello, train and show some of the recent developments in his game. It was so much fun watching some of the evolving facets of my mentors game - some things remained, others were very new - as a total package - so impressive! I love to see development in both the sport overall and in individuals. I am lucky to have been surrounded by great people and involved in the sport long enough to witness both.
