Posture: For every task in grappling there is an ideal posture that maximizes your effectiveness and minimizes your workload. These posture vary wildly depending upon the task at hand. Sometimes it will require upright posture. Sometimes a sprinters posture. Sometimes a hunched posture. The list has as many variations as there are tasks. What works well in one scenario will perform poorly in another. Your task is to understand which posture is suited to which task and then stay as true to that ideal posture as you can until the task is completed and you switch to the next task and a new posture. If you want to know what is the ideal posture for a given task - try the task - you will quickly find that a certain posture makes it seem easier and any deviation from that posture is progressively punished depending on how far you stray from the ideal. At the end of the day this sport of ours is ultimately a game of MOVEMENT and POSTURE before anything else. The deeper your knowledge of these two elements and how they pertain to the goals of the game, the further you will go with everything else in the sport. Here, you can immediately see the positive effect of posture as Georges St Pierre switches from single leg to head inside double leg (often called a Barsargar here in the US). Good posture makes defense difficult and allows him to easily carry and move the weight of a bigger partner.
