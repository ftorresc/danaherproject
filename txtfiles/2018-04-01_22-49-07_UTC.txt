Close relatives: sometimes there are moves and skills that are so closely related to each other that they simply cannot be taught apart from each other, but instead should be taught as one. An example is juji gatame (the arm bar) and the triangle (sankaku). WHENEVER YOU HAVE ONE, YOU HAVE THE OTHER. Thus I teach them as one unified system. Here, MMA athlete, Asim Zaidi, who often travels to NYC to train submission skills with the squad, shows the results of that approach with a fine interplay between arm bar and triangle attacks as he gets a good win against an EBI veteran in a local grappling match.
