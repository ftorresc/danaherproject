Juniors take Manhattan: Outstanding squad juniors, Frank Rosenthal and Jason Rau had fine victories last night at Rise Invitational grappling 4. Mr Rosenthal won the multi grappler tournament - winning both his matches via heel hook and using one of his favorite cross ashi garami finishing sequences to devastating effect in the final against 10th Planet standout Rey Rey to win gold. In the nights headline superfight, Jason Rau took on the outstanding Mike Padilla and won via back strangle and showcase his impressive skills. So proud to these outstanding developing athletes using back and leg systems so well in competition and developing their resumes in spectacular fashion. Keep your eyes on these young men - their rate off progression is impressive!
