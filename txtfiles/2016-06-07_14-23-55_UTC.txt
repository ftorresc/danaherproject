Competition intensity: The majority of training time ought to be concerned with skill acquisition. Accordingly, I often encourage my students to train in an experimental manner where the primary emphasis is on attaining and developing new skills. This is best done by reducing the intensity of training sessions to a level where thinking and learning can occur. It is a very different matter during contest preparation and match time however. Now the athlete operates to impose those skills on a maximally resisting subject. Opponents are often shocked at the intensity of a grappler highly skilled in submissions coming at them with bad intentions. Things get much more interesting when the intent changes from "I will pass your guard or sweep you into a pin and control you," to "I am coming to break or strangle you."
