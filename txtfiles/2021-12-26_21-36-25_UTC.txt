When it all seems confusing…There are many times when the moves of Jiu jitsu seem damn confusing and difficult to perform even in basic drilling with a cooperative partner - forget about live sparring. Whenever this occurs remember this - every move is a sequence of component moves each requiring mechanical details in order to be effectively applied. For any given move, certain stages in that sequence and certain mechanical details are more important to the overall success and failure than the others. If it ever seems too confusing and complicated - FOCUS ONLY ON ONE OR TWO MAJOR FEATURES OF THE MOVE RATHER THAN THE WHOLE MOVE. If you can adequately perform two components of a six stage move on Monday, then add another on Wednesday, two more on Friday and the last on Sunday - you can perform the move in a week. Don’t get discouraged when the whole move doesn’t come quickly - focus on the components instead. Your goal is to learn the move - no one ever said you have to learn it all first time around. I would be happier seeing a student learn and competently demonstrate the first stage of an elbow escape in a session than make a hackneyed and clumsy rendition of the whole move that would never work in sparring. In a single workout - BETTER TO LEARN A PART OF A MOVE WELL THAN THE WHOLE MOVE POORLY - you can always learn the next steps next time.
