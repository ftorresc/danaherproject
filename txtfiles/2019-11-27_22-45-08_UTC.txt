A master of position must perfect chest to chest and chest to back pins, but a master of SUBMISSION must go behind this and actively seek LIMB ISOLATION as the basis of his craft: The basis of offense in traditional Jiu Jitsu is position. Typically this is understood in terms of getting past your opponents legs and pinning him down either chest to chest or chest to back. However, the ability to submit an opponent requires you to go further and isolate a limb - to draw a limb away from the torso and away from the other limb. Only then can you break an opponent. Ultimately this will require you to develop subtle methods of wedging around a limb and trapping it in place long enough to apply the various submission holds of Jiu Jitsu - but your first step is MINDSET. Donâ€™t be satisfied with simply getting the chest to chest or chest to back positions. Train yourself to always think of going the extra step of LIMB ISOLATION after you get to a pin. Initially you will have some frustration here, as the act of isolating a limb often requires movement that can lessen control momentarily and result in an opponent escaping when performed poorly. However, only by persisting and developing this crucial skill will you make the jump from being a pinner to a finisher - the highest ideal of the sport. Look how Gordon Ryan uses an underhook to wedge an opponents arm in place and move his elbow away from form his torso to isolate and weaken the arm. He has moved beyond the safety of chest to chest into the world of isolating wedges that lead to the possibility of submission - this is why his finishing percentages are so high. With patience and practice - so too can yours.
