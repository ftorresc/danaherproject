One selfie - four UFC fighters: UFC standout Rafael "Sapo" Natal takes the selfie of the year at the afternoon class as the squad prepares for upcoming events. Mr Natal is joined by UFC brothers past and present, Jake Shields, who has just moved to NYC to train full time with the squad, David Branch, two division WSOF champion who has just signed with the UFC and begins his run to to the top at 185 pounds , and squad OG, Georges St-Pierre, on the comeback trail. Great afternoon of training in the blue basement - so much ambition, so much potential. These are men who know that ambition, passion, drive, discipline guided by a sensible plan, can create greatness in the gym and build the confidence to take it from the gym to the world stage and do something truly great. Where else can you find a random scene like this on an average Thursday afternoon? #onlyatrenzos ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜œðŸ˜Š
