I am very happy to announce the release of my latest instructional video in the GO FURTHER FASTER Fundamentals series - PASSING GUARD - which focuses on two of the most important skills in all of Jiu Jitsu top game - opening a closed guard and passing an open guard. Ninety percent of our time in Jiu Jitsu is spent either in bottom position retaining/attacking from open guard or passing guard from top position - MAKE SURE THIS FUNDAMENTAL FACT IS REFLECTED IN YOUR TRAINING TIME! As always I present not just a collection of favorite moves, but a complete program to get the job done from start to finish against a skilled opponent. The focus is on the most high percentage guard passing moves in the sport - not the flashiest or coolest - but the ones that really work at the highest levels and work across all belt levels, all weight categories and all types of opponent. If you are interested check out the link in my bio! Wishing you all the best with this crucial part of the game! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
