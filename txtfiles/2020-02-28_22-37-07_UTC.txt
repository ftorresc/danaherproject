On the road! Gordon Ryan (certifiably most dangerous driver in the United States - even more deadly than Garry Tonon and Renzo), Nathalia and myself on the road to Boston for the BJJ Fanatics Grand Prix tournament. Mr Ryan will compete in a fascinating combination of matches against the outstanding United States national freestyle wrestling team member Pat Downey who represented our nation with distinction at the last world championships. The two men will compete in each of their specialized domains. First they will do a no time limit submission only grappling match - which clearly favors Mr Ryan; and then a freestyle wrestling match (both athletes will have to wear wrestling shoes and singlet and follow all current rules of the sport) - which clearly favors Mr Downey. It will be fascinating to see two elite level athletes compete in both their speciality and an unfamiliar sport back to back! Hope you all enjoy the show! See you in Boston!
