Happy Fourth of July from the Blue Basement! Many great things start from a revolution - down in the basement we constantly work to revolutionize ourselves and aspects of the game - but today we also celebrate the most important political revolution that gave rise to the great nation inside whose framework, solidity and freedom we can work to improve ourselves in whatever field we choose. Hope you all have a wonderful 4th of July! ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ¤—ğŸ¤—ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸
