Teaching every aspect of the game: Here is an interesting shot of myself and Gordon Ryan cornering Garry Tonon during his victorious match with Ralek Gracie from a week ago. I don't just teach my students how to grapple. I teach them how to create a complete system of support for an athlete or a team mate through every aspect of preparation and match. Cornering is a skill like any other. I believe there are ways of doing it which can increase by some degree the odds of an athlete winning a match. I knew that I would not be available to corner Garry Tonon at Fight2Win Pro 8 the following week, so I had Gordon Ryan at my side at Metamoris 7 to learn and practice cornering for Fight2Win Pro 8 in seven days time. He did a superb job - helping take his team mate through to another leg lock victory. Metamoris 7 was thus an interesting evening for me as I coached two men in two completely different roles simultaneously - Garry Tonon as an athlete and Gordon Ryan as a corner man/coach. I am happy to say both men passed their respective tests with excellent grades ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
