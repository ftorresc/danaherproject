Senpai returns to inspire the room: Its always a pleasure to see old friends return to the training room. They bring knowledge and experience and something more - the ability to inspire via example. None more so than the most senior (Senpai) student of them all - Georges St-Pierre. Mr St-Pierre came in to train the morning class - the class he used to come to years ago in preparation for his first world title run. Today he drilled and mixed with a new generation of athletes in a different sport - submission grappling - but the presence of a man who reached so far and who wants to reach further still adds an electricity to the training room that always warms my cold heart. That path from the gym to the big stage is one that every professional athlete must trod. None spent more time on that trail than Mr St-Pierre and none went further. What a great example to the kohai (juniors) as they make their own way towards their respective goals.
