Orientation: Our goal is always control that leads to submission. Once you get a submission hold locked on, the defensive reactions from your opponent can be very strong indeed - after all, nobody wants to be the guy that tapped out. One of the more common defensive reactions to some of the major submission holds are turning or spinning escapes. These have an immediate effect - you will have to follow an opponent through three hundred and sixty degrees of rotation (sometimes several times) and STILL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE BREAK OF STRANGLE AT ANY TIME DURING THAT ROTATION. As such, you must train yourself to be able to finish REGARDLESS OF THE ORIENTATION YOU FIND YOURSELF IN. We usually train our submission holds only in conventional or standard orientations, but the reality is that in a competitive match you will have to finish in many unconventional orientations. For all your favorite submissions make your You practice your finishes through a full three hundred and sixty degrees so that you don’t have any surprises when it’s time to finish upside down or back to front in a match. Here, Nicky Ryan follows an opponent through two complete turns and into a third and finishes on an unconventional side with a different form of ashi control against a strongly resisting opponent - the result of practicing finishing from anywhere in dynamic movement.
