What’s next? Here is an unpleasant truth. The vast majority of moves you attempt in Jiu jitsu will fail. This is true regardless of your skill level. The better you get, the better the opponents you will face. You both know the major moves of the sport. You both know the most reliable counters. Therefore, the vast majority of the moves you attempt against someone your own size and skill level will fail. Once you realize this, you realize that the most important question is not “what move should I use?” But rather, “what moves will I follow up with after my initial move.” Your whole way of thinking in Jiu jitsu must reflect the simple reality that most moves against a well matched opponent will fail and that you must always think in terms of WHATS NEXT? This is not something you can reliably figure out in the moment - you can get away with that on occasion but it’s much better to MAP THE OPTIONS OUT IN ADVANCE. I started with an unpleasant truth.
