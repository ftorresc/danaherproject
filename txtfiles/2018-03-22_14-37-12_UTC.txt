Adapting: Garry Tonon learned some aspects of the professional MMA fighters life today - going to various media obligations, rules meetings, medical checks, preliminary weight and hydration tests etc. In the end, however, the athlete’s greatest responsibility is training, for without that, he or she would never rise to the level where they would have to go through all those chores in the first place - so at the end of a long day - it’s back to the gym for drills. Now we head to a light dinner and back to the hotel. Tomorrow is the official weigh in and then all promotional responsibilities fulfilled.
