Nice work Mr Sonnen: Chael Sonnen is doing a good job with his fledgling grappling show and tonight put on an entertaining show that featured some very nice grappling action showcasing the area between MMA and grappling using EBI rules format to create fast paced matches with plenty of action. Squad members Garry Tonon and Gordon Ryan were there. Mr Ryan took on Kentucky leg locking specialist Joe Baize. He told me prior to the match he would limit himself to guillotines and juji/sankaku (armbar/triangle) finishes. That is a very challenging way to enter a match - but he did it with a nicely applied juji out of sankaku control. Mr Tonon fought a tough match against his much larger opponent, Antonio Carlos Jr. All credit to Mr Carlos Jr. He hit a splendid flying sankaku and finished it in excellent fashion to win a fine victory. Sometimes fighting at the highest levels can be a topsy turvy experience - just last week, Gordon Ryan defeated Mr Carlos Jr via sankaku (a different variation) at Sapeteiro 6. When very talented athletes fight, just one little error or miscalculation can determine the result and so there can be total shifts in victories and losses within a week, as happened here - that's what makes the sport so interesting! Now the squad must go into training for more matches next weekend in California ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
