It begins again: Chris Weidman @chrisweidmanufc successfully weighs in today in hometown Long Island in preparation for his fight tomorrow against the formidable Kelvin Gastulem. It has been a joy seeing the old gang together again, Ray Longo and Matt Serra, along with the pride in Mr Weidmans heart in headlining a UFC in the town in which he grew up and to which he is fiercely attached. Also on the card is RGA standout @rafaelsaponatal in what should be a great New York night of MMA. Now a quiet night of rehydration, refueling and game planning and then action tomorrow night!
