When the gi comes off: Jiu jitsu is a sport with four faces. Gi grappling, No gi grappling, MMA Jiu jitsu and self defense Jiu jitsu. Though they are all part of the same family there are significant differences between them. When it comes to gi vs no gi grappling it’s important to ask what the most significant differences are between them and even more importantly - what the consequences of those differences are when you’re on the mat trying to improve. The three most obvious differences are simple enough - First, the gi provides a much greater number and efficiency of strangles. Second, the gi provides a much greater variety and robustness of grips. Third, the gi provides much greater friction between the two athletes that slows the pace of the match in most areas. Getting further into the discussion, the idea of GRIP has important practical ramifications. The grips provided by the gi allow for much greater overall pulling power than the no gi pulling grips. A grip on the lapel is like a grip on a rope - very robust and difficult to break. None of the basic no gi grips can compare in robustness to the grips one can make with the jacket and pants, especially when sweat is factored in. The one great exception to this is LOCKED HANDS. Locking your hands around your opponents waist, head and arm or upper legs (and many other more specific applications) creates by far the strongest and most robust pulling force available no gi. It is crucial you learn to harness and utilize its power and control. You can’t always lock your hands, nor is it always desirable to do so - but when it is - no other no gi grip gives you such a robust pulling grip that allows you to control the toughest and slipperiest opponents and get to your score or submission.
