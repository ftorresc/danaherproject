Maintaining a legacy: Young Rayron Gracie, just fifteen years old, son of legendary Ryan Gracie, competed in the IBJJF World Championships this weekend, winning his first world title at Ultra-heavy juvenile blue belt in an outstanding performance that promises much for the future. Mr Gracie moved to NYC to train with his Uncle Renzo Gracie and cousins, Igor, Rolles and Gregor Gracie and has made incredible progress. In addition to his rapidly growing technical skill, he is renown for having a heart as big as his body - this young man will be a giant when he grows up! Keep your eyes on this one - already a world champion and has his eyes set on many more titles! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
