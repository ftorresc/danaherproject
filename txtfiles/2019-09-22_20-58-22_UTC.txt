Fifty percent of Jiu Jitsu is DENYING YOUR OPPONENT THE SAME THINGS YOU AIM TO DO TO HIM. We all practice as much as possible the things we want to do to our opponent - but at least fifty percent of your time should be spent in those skills of denial - of STOPPING HIM FROM DOING WHAT HE WANTS. I love to see my students practice offense - but I make damn sure they never neglect their defense because we all have a natural tendency to under emphasize it. So get out there and practice your skills of denial - the better your opponents get - the more you will need them!
