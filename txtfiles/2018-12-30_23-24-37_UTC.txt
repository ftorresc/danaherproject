Getting work done: Just finished fifth and final day of filming for BJJ Fanatics where we completed the ENTER THE SYSTEM series (Triangle system to be released very soon and then subsequently the Arm Bar system to complete the series) and began work on the upcoming BJJ Fundamentals series where I go over classical BJJ in a new light designed to deepen your insight into the sport and shorten your learning time in skill development. Today we worked on the Gi Strangle system that I teach. Itâ€™s a blast going over the fundamentals in a new way - this is the heart and soul of Jiu Jitsu and I love it! This was the material that hooked me twenty five years ago and I never lost my passion for it! Now itâ€™s back to the bus station (trains all sold out ðŸ˜ž) and back to NYC - Looking forward to getting back to the blue basement for a day of teaching tomorrow!
