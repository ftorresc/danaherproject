Ink to paper: A big day for Georges St-Pierre today as he inked the contract for his return to the octagon on November 4 in the  world headquarters of the fight world - Madison Square Garden, New York City, against current middle weight champion, Michael Bisping. This is a huge test for Mr St-Pierre. First, it will be four years since his last fight. Second, it is in a weight class above his own. By the end of his career, Mr St-Pierre was a very averaged size welterweight, now he is taking on a big middleweight. In addition, Mr St-Pierre has been through two acl surgeries - this will be a very stern test indeed - no warm up fights - right back into the fray after a very long lay off against the bigger champion. However, in my coaching experience there has never been an athlete so well suited to taking on the most difficult of tasks and finding a way to break through to success. Mr St-Pierre is much more than a great athlete. He is a strategist of the highest order,
Both in preparation and in the cage. The professionalism of his approach is unparalleled in my experience and I am certain that on November 4th he will be ready for action and these two legends of the octagon will put on a show worthy of the incredible fight history of Madison Square Garden. Grappling training will run concurrently with the squad's preparation for adcc world championships and will make for some incredible training experiences  I am sure. Looking forward to seeing the troops gather for another battle and a Season of plotting, scheming, training, experimenting and learning.
