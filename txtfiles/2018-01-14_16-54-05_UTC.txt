Meanwhile, back in New York...The squad kohai (Juniors) went on a rampage this weekend at the Rise Invitational Grappling competition last night. My great friend and Renzo Gracie alumni, Matt Serra has a very talented student, Jason Rau, who he sent to train with us. Mr Rau has worked hard to become one of the best in the room and last night defeated 10th Planet standout, Jon “Thor” Blank via submission (sankaku/ triangle variation). In addition, Frank Rosenthal showcased his rapid improvement by winning gold in the event 8 man tournament that featured EBI standouts JM Holland from 10th Planet and Mike Davila. Mr Rosenthal defeated Mr Davila via strangle in the final to take first place. Stanley Rosa from @bxmartialarts also won in a fine display from these talented young men. Great to see their hard work and drive being converted into shekels, notoriety and medals!
