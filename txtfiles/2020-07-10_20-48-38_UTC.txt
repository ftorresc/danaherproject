Turtle breakdowns in Jiu jitsu: Many grappling sports feature turtle breakdowns. You see them in wrestling, Judo and Sambo. The INTENT of turtle breakdowns in these grappling styles is usually very different from Jiu jitsu however. Jiu jitsu is very unique among grappling styles in so far as it awards points (maximum points actually) to rear mounted positions. In Judo, wrestling and Sambo, the primary goal is not to get hooks in and rear mount - that score no points in itself - but rather to turn the opponents back and shoulders towards the floor into a classic pin. So the whole direction of turtle breakdowns in Jiu jitsu is quite different. The primary focus is on getting your two legs hooked into his hips to attain the rear mount - it does not matter whether you end on top or bottom - if you get two hooks in you score. Interestingly, in other grappling styles such as Judo if you topple an opponent from turtle and end up in a side pin you can win the match if you hold him down for a period of time. In Jiu jitsu the same action would score you nothing. The different rule structure leads athletes in different sports in very different directions. When practicing Jiu jitsu always keep this in mind and make your primary focus the rear mount position. It gets you the maximum points score and puts you immediately in position for the most high percentage submission in the sport - rear strangles. Here, master of back control and strangles, Gordon Ryan practices his craft.
