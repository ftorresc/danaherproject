Aggression: A key feature of good jiu jitsu is a spirit of active aggression throughout a match. When I say aggression, I donâ€™t mean it as we do in normal daily discourse, where it typically has a negative connotation and usually implies antisocial behavior. In a sport context it simply means the desire to actively pursue victory, in particular, the most complete victory possible, in the case of jiu jitsu - submission victory. It is a desire to go out and actively pursue the ideal of the sport - control leading to submission. One of the biggest problems in previous ADCC events has been slow paced tactical play where athletes sought to win by doing the least work possible, by taking the least risk. This is a very successful strategy for many, but it runs contrary to the spirit of the sport and makes for disastrous viewing. The most popular competitors have always been those who took risks and had the skills to make those risks profitable. I was very happy to see the officials at this years world championships actively calling out stalling penalties on a regular basis to keep the action moving. The result was a much faster paced event, fewer overtime periods, and a very high rate of submission for such an elite field of athletes. Some of the biggest names in the sport got caught in submissions this year and it made for very compelling viewing. In general I prefer the athletes to do the work of winning and losing themselves, with as little referee intervention as possible, but this ADCC showed how good work by impartial officials can significantly improve an event and help keep it in line with the ideals of the sport. Coaches must take the bulk of the responsibility for making athletes compete with an aggressive spirit, but some help from competent and fair officials is a welcome helping hand. I came away form the event thinking it was one of the most exciting in years and hope that this trend can be extended into future events. Photo by @banejitsu
