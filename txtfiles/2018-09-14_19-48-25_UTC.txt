Visitors: Itâ€™s always fun having talented visitors come by the academy. This weekend the No Gi Pan Am Championships is being held in NYC so many great jiu jitsu athletes came in for training including two of my favorites @samuelbragagb and @talitaalencarbjj They had a great time working out with the squad and getting ready for competition day. Wishing best of luck to all the Pan Am athletes especially Samuel and Talita!
