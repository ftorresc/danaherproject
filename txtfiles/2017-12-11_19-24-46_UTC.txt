Aussie in Manhattan: Outstanding Australian Grappling star, Craig Jones came by the blue basement to train with the squad in the morning class today! When I was visiting family in Australia, Mr Jones’ gym in Melbourne was very welcoming when I taught a leg lock seminar - it was a pleasure to return the favor and host Mr Jones here in our town 😊 When squad members achieve notable wins we have a tradition of awarding them a finely made knife as we consider the blade the perfect metaphor for our life in jiu jitsu. In true Crocodile Dundee in NYC fashion, Mr Jones looked at the knife and deadpanned, “That’s not a knife...” 😂😂 A wave to all our Australian friends - Mr Jones is an amazing example to us all, Australian or otherwise, as to what can be achieved by dedicated, self starting individuals far away from the more well known centers of the sport.
