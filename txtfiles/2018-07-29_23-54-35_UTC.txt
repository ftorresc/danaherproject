From one mat to another: Teaching yesterday in the Philippines- then twenty seven hour flight home - now teaching back on the mats of the blue basement in NYC ðŸ˜œ From mat to mat the game is the same - keep learning and keep improving- no matter how small the progress, have faith that it will accrue over time to become something substantial. No matter where you are or who shares the mat with you; there is something you can learn and practice so that the next time you step on the mat, wherever it might be, you are better than the previous time. Looking forward to upcoming projects with the squad and all my students at RGA starting tomorrow! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
