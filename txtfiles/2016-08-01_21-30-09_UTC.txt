Georges St-Pierre marvels at the incredible sleeping technique of Garry Tonon napping between morning and noon classes. Note the very advanced "inverted mummy" posture utilized by Mr Tonon. A posture that would asphyxiate normal humans in their sleep whilst simultaneously resulting in a severely flattened face, yet somehow Mr Tonon manages to wake up from this and immediately drill high amplitude takedowns with Mr St-Pierre. Not quite sure what Mr Sigmund Freud would say about this sleeping posture, but I believe there is a clear subconscious desire to defend the neck at all times being shown here ðŸ˜‰
