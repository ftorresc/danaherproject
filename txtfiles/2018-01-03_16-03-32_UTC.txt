There are three things in which I have total faith and upon which I have built my career.  The laws of physics, the ability of a well constructed and rational training program to improve performance in a given task so that over time people can overcome obstacles and fears and get to their goals; and the ability of a few highly motivated and skilled people to create change across an entire population of people. In a world of doubt and uncertainty I would stake my life upon these.
