Heavyweights: Very often people ask me whether they should train differently based upon their size. In truth, I train my heavyweights exactly the same way I train my lightweights. I find that they adapt very well in time and often surprise their opponents in the heavyweight division with their agility and transitions. Here one one Georges St-Pierre's best friends, who we call "Big Will" (I have no idea why ðŸ˜‰) shows how a heavyweight can easily adapt our ashi garami leg lock system at a recent grappling event in Canada.  It always pleases me when people confound people's expectations. Big Will enters and rolls around the leg like a man half his size to secure a very nice heel hook indeed ðŸ˜Š Unfortunately his understanding of the rules was not as good as his leg locking skills and he was immediately disqualified as heel hooks were illegal in this tournament! Oops! ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰ Still, the physical lesson of size being less relevant to movement than most people think is there to be seen ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
