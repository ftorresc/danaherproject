Comeback: Founding member of the squad, Georges St-Pierre will be returning to UFC competition. Mr St-Pierre has always privately expressed interest in a return to professional fighting to his coaches. His original reason for retirement was most due to the virtually uncontrolled use of PEDs in MMA competition. The UFC has, through its partnership with USADA, made considerable progress in this area. While not perfect, the situation is definitely better than three years ago. After some hiccups in negotiating a return, a deal has been signed and Mr St-Pierre will begin moving forward towards competition. Returning to top level competition is never an easy thing in any sport. as the old saying goes, time is a cruel thief who robs us of our former selves. The skills of MMA are highly perishable and getting them back after three years of inactivity and two major knee operations is a difficult task indeed - made more so by the speed at which the sport itself changes and evolves. However, if there is one person to do it, it is Mr St-Pierre. He will take on the challenge with his usual drive and perfectionism. It is not yet settled who his first opponent shall be, nor the time it shall be fought, but as soon as Mr St-Pierre is ready, training and preparation will begin in earnest. It will be interesting watching the younger squad members work in grappling with Mr St-Pierre, and then Mr St-Pierre with them in MMA. I am sure there will be some memorable training sessions!
