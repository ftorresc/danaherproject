When I first started coaching my primary interest was MMA. I prayed to the gods to send me great students. They sent me the incomparable Georges St-Pierre and Chris Weidman,  who both rode thunder and lightning all the way to world championship immortality. When I switched my attention to grappling, again I prayed to the gods...I must have somehow angered or displeased them, because this time they sent me a bunch of dorks and nerds! What the hell is this?! Post training photo reveals the extent of geekiness in the squad! All appear to be utterly hopeless nerds who could not strangle a quadruple amputee! It amazes me that these dorks ever won a single match! The gods must truly hate me to send such a collection of slack-jawed simpletons for instruction in the kingly art #hopingforbetterlucknexttime
