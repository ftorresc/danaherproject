Getting ready for Australia! Immediately after Garry Tononâ€™s fight in Singapore @onechampionship and my super seminar at @evolvemma I will head to Australia to see my family and catch with the Australian Jiu Jitsu scene ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š I will probably go first to Melbourne and teach (tentatively) November 11 Sunday afternoon at John Donahueâ€™s school (Back attacks) and then a different topic at Nemesis MMA on Monday evening November 12. After than I will head to Sydney for a big two day seminar for KMA martial arts @KMA salievski on Saturday and Sunday teaching back attacks and leg attacks. Apparently the initial seminar at KMA completely sold out so we will run a second one day seminar on Sunday afternoon  for those who could not get tickets for the initial offering - contact KMA for details. In addition I will be teaching friends at @vt1martialarts in Sydney with Liam Resnekov. It will be great to see old friends in Australia- itâ€™s amazing how far Aussie grappling has come since last time I was there - hope I can help it go even further!
