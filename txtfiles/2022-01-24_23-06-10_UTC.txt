When you’ve got a simple goal…Very often Jiu jitsu requires us to enter into fast and complex scrambles where it’s hard to know what to do because there are so many variables and so little time to figure things out. My advice is this: play scrambles with a few simple heuristics - simple rules of thumb that give you a CLEAR SENSE OF DIRECTION in the most confusing scrambles. Here, Georges St Pierre and his partner are in fast motion. There are good possibilities for both athletes. From Georges’ perspective the heuristic KEEP YOUR OPPONENTS HIPS BETWEEN YOUR KNEES gives clear and concise advise that will direct him through the scramble and allow him to finish in winning position. The more complex and dynamic the situation - the more valuable simple and effective rules become for guidance.
