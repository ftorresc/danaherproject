Working against skilled resistance: The true measure of competence in the application of any given jiu jitsu move is not whether you know how to perform it per se; but whether you can perform it against skilled and knowledgeable resistance and counters. At this stage, everyone knows my students have strong leg locks. When they go out to compete, their opponents have done much research and deeply practiced countering the expected leg attacks. Yet in the vast majority of cases, my students break through the resistance and get to their submission hold. So many times I meet people who think it is enough to know how to perform the move in basic drill form, and from this erroneously believe they have a working knowledge of the move. The rubric we work with cannot be "I can perform the move," but rather, "I can perform this move against skilled and knowledgeable resistance." The former will gain you victory only against beginners and the incompetent; the latter will take you to championship level. Here, Gordon Ryan follows the movements of his rival Matt Arroyo through multiple defensive twists and turns and hand fighting to get a fine submission victory against strong resistance in EBI 8 on the path to gold.
