Young masters: One of the great cliches of martial arts is that old masters have vast reservoirs of knowledge that younger athletes don’t and therefore that younger athletes may be very good in competition but won’t be very good as teachers until presumably they become much older and then they become great teachers. This is complete hogwash. What counts in Jiu jitsu wisdom is not your physical age but rather your accumulated time on the mat and the quality of that time. For example, I would much rather be instructed by a twenty year old who had trained every day from an early age and who was totally immersed in the sport and studied everything from fundamentals to cutting edge material and logged an impressive fifteen thousand hours on the mats than a fifty five year old who trained once a week and who had only logged around four thousand hours of mat time. When it comes to knowledge accumulated mat time is a far more reliable indicator of knowledge than physical age. Add to that the quality of mat time - depth of study, ability to articulate that knowledge to others, degree to which experimentation and research was performed over that mat time etc - and this is what will tell you is the degree of expertise they possess, not their age. I am constantly amazed at the teaching prowess of my young students, Garry Tonon, Gordon Ryan, Craig Jones and Nicky Ryan have a depth of knowledge that would deeply impress the older generations in the sport. Remember that Sir Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein revolutionized the world with their knowledge in their early twenties - no one tried to dismiss their ideas because they were young. Martial arts are no different. There are young masters out there who have built incredible stores of knowledge that can change your game
