When you’re tired: All the combat sports are exhausting in their own way. The bad news is - they stay exhausting your whole career. As you get better and better, so do your opponents - so you’ll always be under great physical stress that has your body drenched in sweat and chest heaving, utterly exhausted after a rough round. IT’S OK TO BE TIRED - BUT IT’S NOT OK TO SHOW IT. Learning to mask fatigue is an important skill in itself. Your opponents draw hope and optimism from seeing you exhausted. A tired opponent who is himself thinking of quitting will find renewed energy and drive if he sees you doubled over with exhaustion with the posture of a beaten man. If you are a competitive athlete (obviously what i am saying does not hold true for recreational athletes, older athletes, beginners or if you’re simply out of shape due to interruption in your training routine) When you’re tired, practice holding your composure and posture. No matter how hard your heart is beating and lungs burning - stand tall and composed, face neutral - YOUR FACE IS A MASK FOR WHATS REALLY GOING ON INSIDE YOUR HEAD - when an opponent can penetrate the mask he gains strength - when he can’t - he loses hope. Controlling your body language under stress is a real skill, and like any skill - it’s needs practice - practice begins next time you’re feeling like you’ve got nothing left to give.
