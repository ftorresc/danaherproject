Guard passing and leg locks: A common sentiment in Jiu jitsu is that leg locks and guard passing are like oil and water - they don’t mix and you either do one of the other when on top and confronted by an opponent’s guard. This is absolutely not the case. Guard passing and leg locks actually compliment each other extremely well. The threat of leg locks often causes an opponent to play very cautiously with his legs and leg positioning making guard passing considerably easier. The threat of guard passing often causes an opponent to reach injudiciously with their legs and become very vulnerable to leg locks. The pressure and threat of one facilitates the success of the other. WHEN PLAYING ONE GAME DON’T BLIND YOURSELF TO THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE OTHER. Here, Garry Tonon switches back into the legs after a hard passing exchange.
