When you have a good position - TAKE YOUR TIME: One of the traits of good Jiu Jitsu players is that they know when they have to hustle and when they can slow things down. A great skill that you need to develop is that of CONSOLIDATION. When you get a good position - LET THE POSITION DO THE WORK FOR YOU. The only time you should be working hard is when you don’t have a good position. The whole purpose of good position is that it creates a situation where the other guy has to do more work than you do. If you are working harder than him when you are winning something is wrong. Next time you get a position take your physical tension down a notch and switch your effort to the mental game of plotting your next move. As the body relaxes, the mind gets more active and it’s the mind that will guide you to your next step.
