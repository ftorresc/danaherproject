Big weekend for the squad: Garry Tonon wins a hard fought match against a very tough Ralek Gracie via leg lock submission. It was a fascinating camp and match as we knew very little about the opponent other than the fact that he was around 40 pounds heavier than Mr Tonon and came from a very fine grappling pedigree. Mr Gracie showed excellent defensive poise and training, a credit to his family heritage, but in the end, Mr Tonon was able to  break through successfully with a fine variation of a kneebar out of ushiro ashi garami. Here we all relax with the two stars of the weekend - Eddie Cummings and Garry Tonon, who won every match they entered this weekend via submission and advanced our method of grappling in a way that was very pleasing indeed. Now I have to go straight to airport and fly home to NYC and get ready to teach tomorrow morning!
