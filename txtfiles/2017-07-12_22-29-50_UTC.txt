Creating a connection and changing a mindset: Normally when we think of instruction in jiu jitsu we think of our daily technical lessons that aim to improve the precision with which we apply technique. There is however, an entirely different kind of instruction that is of equally great importance (and in some ways even greater importance). I am talking about INSIGHT THAT CREATES IN THE STUDENT A NEW POINT OF VIEW THAT CHANGES THE DIRECTION OF THEIR STUDY AND GIVES THEIR TECHNIQUE A SENSE OF DIRECTION. Consider an example from my sensei, Renzo Gracie. When I was a white belt, I hated bottom position and always sought to fight on top. Mr Gracie had observed me in training and one day when we talked I expressed my preference for getting to mounted position and doing everything from there. Mr Gracie said to me, "John, you realize the guard is just the mounted position upside down," and walked away, leaving me fascinated and suddenly eager to try a position that I had totally avoided and which he wanted me to train. It was a simple, and in retrospect, not entirely true point - but it opened my mind to a new direction in training - and that is precisely what it was intended to do. Years later its effects can still be seen. A cornerstone of my coaching philosophy is that in grappling (not fighting) top and bottom are neutral with regards our ability to enter effectively into submissions. I never forgot the power of insight as a mode of instruction over and above technical lessons. Here I discuss approaches to sankaku, the triangle, with Nicky Ryan, a technique in which he excels. Over and above the mechanics of a given move, there must be a GUIDING PHILOSOPHY which gives the techniques direction and creates a genuine sense of self expression in the athlete
