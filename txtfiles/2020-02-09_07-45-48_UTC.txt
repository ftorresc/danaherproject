Barriers: @blondefighter Katlyn Chookagian was stopped in the third round by the great champion Valentina Schevchenko tonight here in Houston. Ms Schevchenko showed her championship pedigree with a powerful performance both on the feet and the floor, winning via TKO with strikes from a very well applied side crucifix after an excellent upper body takedown. What makes me proud of the athletes i work with is never the  events result - that is never fully determined by us - but rather their preparation for the event - which IS determined by us. Ms Chookagian May not have won the championship tonight but she showed a champions mindset with her preparation. She gave her all in camp and got to the best level possible in the time available. She fought with courage, holding nothing back - there is nothing more any of us can do than that. Barriers are in front of all of us. Some we can rise over without much effort. Some can stop us in our tracks. The greatest test of who we are is our reaction to those barriers, both as we approach them and try to climb them. Ms Chookagianâ€™s first reaction backstage was to ask when she can get back to training and start climbing barriers again. She took only superficial damage so  it wonâ€™t take long for the journey to begin again soon. Whatever the outcome may have been - Thatâ€™s a champion right there ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Šwishing you all the best from Texas! Hope you all enjoyed the show! Thanks as always to the team! @mcmahon_pj  @babyfacebenoit @coachmarkhenry @kycerm for all their great work in preparation
