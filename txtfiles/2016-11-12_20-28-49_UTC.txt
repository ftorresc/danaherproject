Heavy artillery: The UFC has gone all out to bring in the big guns for UFC 205 tonight in NYC. For the first time, the UFC is on stage at Madison Square Garden tonight. This is the stage that in another era hosted Ali vs Frazier to decide the world's most eminent fighter. Now in the modern era it hosts a slew of great fighters in the best combat sport to launch operations in New York. Has there ever been so much talent in one event? I remember in the 90's going to small sports bars in NYC trying to find a place that would show the sport - it was banned on cable and could only be seen on satellite TV. Now it is in the premier venue in America in shining lights. Thank you to all the remarkable men and women who have made this transition possible - this is a special night for the fans, but also for the sport itself ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
