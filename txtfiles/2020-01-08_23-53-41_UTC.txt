A Jiu Jitsu player can learn to live with many things, a broken arm, a broken leg, hell, even a broken heart - but one thing he or she can NEVER learn to live with is a broken POSTURE. Your stance and posture is the basis of everything you do in this sport. Almost every failure on our part in Jiu Jitsu can be traced back to an earlier failure in stance and posture. For all the main positions and moves there is an ideal posture to get the job done efficiently. The further you stray from that ideal the harder you will have to work to make up for it and the more likely you will be countered. Take some time to study great players and switch your attention from the MOVES to their STANCE/POSTURE THAT PRECEDES THE MOVES. You will see patterns that are easy to learn and easy to bring into your game and then the game itself may become a little easier for you.
