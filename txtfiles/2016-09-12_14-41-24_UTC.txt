When knowledge, skill, discipline and tactics come together and are given direction through a guiding vision - great things happen. Gordon Ryan shows near perfect form last night in the finals of EBI 8 with a heel hook variation that won him gold over the very tough and talented Kyle Griffen ( who was himself involved in some truly epic bouts before this one). His training leading up to the event was superb and it was a thrill for his great mentor and friend, Garry Tonon, younger brother, Nicky Ryan and myself to watch his work from the corner. Now the four of us will train today to get Garry Tonon ready for his bouts in Florida this weekend! I hope you all enjoyed the show and another look at the philosophy, tactics and techniques of our approach to jiu jitsu
