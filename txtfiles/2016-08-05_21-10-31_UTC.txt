Match preparation: Gordon Ryan prepares for his upcoming bout with the immensely talented Keenan Cornelius, without question among the finest grapplers in the world today. Mr Cornelius  is equally talented gi and no gi, positional skills and submission skills. He brings a considerable weight, height and experience advantage, but Mr Ryan is very happy to take on such a great man - an attitude I see so often among emerging champions. Here we work on positional skills in open guard scenarios, an area that Mr Ryan often impresses me.
