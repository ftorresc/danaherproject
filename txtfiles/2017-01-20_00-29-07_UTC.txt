Last day of training: This weekend will see the sixth installment of the growing Sapateiro Invitational grappling event. They use a slightly modified EBI format to put on excellent submission only events. Sapateiro 6 is notable for the incredible amount of talent they have brought in - there are three EBI finalists, an ADCC champion, several ADCC competitors- it is probably fair to say it has a more stacked field than any single EBI event! Gordon Ryan has battled through a mystery illness this camp that has still not been resolved after nearly four months, but has trained without fail with the resolve and discipline of a true stoic. He will take with him his understudy, Matthew Tesla. Mr Tesla has been training at a very high level and gave a very strong performance at the recent ADCC trials. This will be his first big show - the first of many I am sure - for he has a wealth of talent to show off. Building athletes to a peak is always an exciting process - thanks goes to the organizers of Sapeteiro 6 for creating a venue and a thrilling line up for these talented athletes to showcase their individual skills and the appeal of the sport in general. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
