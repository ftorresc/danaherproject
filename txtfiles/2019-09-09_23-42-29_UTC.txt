Using your head: The phrase “using your head” usually means to use your intelligence to perform a task better - that’s a wonderful ideal that you should use at every opportunity - but in this instance I’m talking about using your actual head (not brain) to perform tasks in grappling. Your head is an incredibly important means of PUSHING an opponent. When you use it is often frees up your hands to perform other tasks. You must actively seek to use your head whenever possible to move and control an opponent. A very big part of this sport is the PUSH/PULL DYNAMIC that underlies much of the game. Most people only push and pull with their hands and feet - give yourself a fifth pushing limb by actively using your head and you will have a big advantage over your four limbed opponent’s - now THAT’S Using your head! 😜😜
