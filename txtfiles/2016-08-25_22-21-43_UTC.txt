Grapple Boxing: My average day is mostly concerned with teaching jiu jitsu, but sometimes my students compete in MMA and then I teach a very different curriculum which I call grapple boxing. This is the merging of grappling and striking technique on the floor - very different from pure jiu jitsu. I always hated the usual term for this skill "ground and pound" as it implies that only the athlete on top who has performed the takedown does the striking - which is not true at all. Moreover, the term "pound" implies a brutish, clumsy activity rather than a highly refined skill, which it certainly is at the higher levels. My students Georges St-Pierre and Chris Weidman were both masters of this critical element of MMA and both could inflict severe damage in seconds. Developing a system of grapple boxing was one of the most interesting and rewarding elements of my coaching career - it was done during the change over of MMA from its beginnings as a single discipline activity to the modern era. It created new skills not seen in twentieth century arts (I suspect they have not been seen in such detail since the Ancient Greek Pankration) and it was thrilling to be a small part of that movement in the sport. I had the privilege of working with students who learned and used it extremely well. Here, Georges St-Pierre shows great poise as he unleashes grapple boxing technique on Carlos Condit - himself a fine grapple boxer during their titanic championship match in Montreal
