Garry Tonon getting ready: The big show in Tokyo draws closer. @onechampionship has sold out for their biggest card ever. Today was another step towards the cage as Garry Tonon went through his drills in the midst of cutting weight and the various media obligations that come with big events. It was fun going back to the hotel with tour guide Matt Hume through the Tokyo train system at rush hour! This city is amazing! So busy but so well organized! NYC looks like total anarchy and chaos in comparison! ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ Here we are after this afternoons workout - so impressive to watch the dedication that Mr Tonon outs into his preparation and skill development - itâ€™s hard to believe that itâ€™s still less than a year since his first fight! His prodigious training routine helps make up for his short time in the sport.
