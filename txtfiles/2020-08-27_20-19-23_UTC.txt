When behind an opponent - create a constant threat of strangulation - everything else you feeds off this: The back is the ultimate position in no gi grappling (and you could also argue that the same is true in gi Jiu jitsu and fighting). However, like any position, it has its limitations and getting the position does not guarantee victory against tough opponents. It is very important then, that you create a constant and unrelenting threat of strangulation from the back so that your opponent MUST address it or perish. If you ever see your opponent getting forgetful and raising his chin - go! Snake your wrist under the chin and finish him! If he is disciplined with his chin position, use his defensive chin and hands against him with arm traps and mandible strangles that make defense very difficult indeed.
