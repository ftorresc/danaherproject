Joe Rogan and I finish up podcast on various jiu jitsu and MMA related themes in LA. Afterwards, Mr Rogan demonstrated some fascinating thoughts on the use of lead leg and turning side kicks for MMA showing very impressive power and speed. I really believe that the influence Mr Rogan is one of the main reasons why ground fighting is still a big part of UFC events. In an age where most fans just want to see two fighters work in standing position, he constantly encourages and educates fans on the value of ground fighting. As such he has done a huge service to the sport and jiu jitsu. It was a pleasure to talk with him today. Hope you all enjoyed the show!
