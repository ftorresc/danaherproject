Teaching one of the biggest seminars of the year in Maryland - Two hundred strong learning leg and back systems. So proud to watch Gordon Ryan teaching like a college professor to a fascinated audience and showing  jiu jitsu maturity far beyond his years. Thank you so much to the people of Maryland and surrounding districts for their enthusiasm!
