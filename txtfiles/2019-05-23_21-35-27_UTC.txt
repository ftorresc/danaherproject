Nicky Ryan back onstage in England this weekend: Nicky Ryan will take on MMA superstar, the great Urijah Faber, this weekend at @polaris_professional grappling event. The event features squad juniors, @ethancrelinsten and @nickyrod247 along with our friend @craigjonesbjj I always love the interface between grappling and MMA and Mr Faber was a fine example of this. He was a very fine wrestler and long time student of Jiu Jitsu throughout his long and distinguished MMA career. I often find that many people badly underestimate the pure grappling skill of many top MMA athletes and when they see them in grappling they are shocked at how good many of them are. I have witnessed many occasions where top grapplers were brought into MMA fight camps and had a very hard time going against MMA stars even in pure grappling. Mr Faber has a great mix of wrestling and Jiu Jitsu and uses them very well together and has a fine guillotine attack on top of that. Mr Ryan has very refined technique but will have to overcome a significant strength advantage of he is to prevail in this fascinating match up. @garrytonon is just off his latest MMA victory and is in England for coaching and cornering the youngsters (in between eating hamburgers and English pudding - I think he may be over three hundred pounds at this point). Keep your eyes on this event!!
