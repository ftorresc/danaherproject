The surest sign: A coach always wonders how far a student will go to get to their potential. In truth the degree to which you will rise to your potential is proportional to your willingness to invest time, energy and intelligent planning into your development in the skills required to get where you want to. One of the surest signs of a strong commitment to your growth is the time it takes for a student to return to the gym to renew training after a major competition. Iâ€™m not so impressed when an athlete comes back immediately after a loss - everyone feels like training hard after the sting of a loss. Its when they come back immediately to train and grow after a big WIN that impresses me most. Most people will relax and lay off work after a win - but the truly ambitious just see that win as a stepping stone to a still greater self and get back to work and growth as soon as possible.
