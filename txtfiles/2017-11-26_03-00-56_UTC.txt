It ainâ€™t easy keeping up with the squad: At the house of our gracious host Mo Jassim, his faithful English Bulldogs have been keeping us company as we work hard on submission skills in preparation for upcoming events. Looks like the last ashi garami session took a toll on this poor fellow! Having fun out here on the West Coast. Looking forward to early seminar at Shawn Williams academy tomorrow before the metamoris event and then back into training! I think by Sunday night I will be sleeping right next to this bulldog! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
