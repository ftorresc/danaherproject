Garry Tonon makes weight - all systems go! Garry Tonon Just successfully weighed in here in Tokyo for his fight tomorrow at @onechampionship Here we are going back to the hotel to recharge. It’s Cherry Blossom season here in Japan and there is a beautiful Temple next door which is popular for traditional weddings which are going on as a large groups of MMA athletes prepare for action tomorrow - such an odd contrast - but a rather poignant one as the essence of martial arts is controlled power. Though our business is ultimately a violent one, it is always sublimated to be contained within a peaceful social setting - that’s what differentiates a martial artist from a thug - so it’s beautiful to observe wedding guests intermingled with some of the baddest people on the planet as naturally as birds with the cherry blossoms above them. Wishing you all the best from Tokyo! Hope you all enjoy the big show!
