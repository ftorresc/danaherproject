Know the strong points of each positional variation: Jiu jitsu gives you a LOT of choice. Any given position has many variations within it - each of those variations has it good points and bad points. Each presents elements that suit your body type in some ways and frustrates it in others. Take guard position for example. There are dozens of different types of guard. Each different configuration offers different connection to an opponent and hence different possibilities for attack. It is important you understand that connection and it’s ramifications for your attack choice. Take closed guard for example. It’s most important feature is that locks your hips on top of your opponents hips so that even though your body as a whole is underneath your opponents body, the most important part of your body, your hips, are on top of the most important part of your opponents body - his hips. This has important ramifications. It means that any sweep or reversal that maintains that hip connection will result in a sweep directly to mounted position  rather than merely a sweep to top position as is the case with most guard sweeps - after all, closed guard is essentially just an upside down mount position as far as body connection goes. This insight tells you that almost any form of submission you can employ from mount will be applicable from guard - the set ups will be different given the change from top to bottom - but technique selection will be the same. It means that any form of go behind that gets you around and behind your opponents arms will lead directly to rear mount. Knowing the most important feature of each given position in Jiu jitsu will give you the insights you need to direct your attacks better. Don’t just associate a position with a list of attacks - look for it’s deeper mechanical basis and you will see further than your opponents
