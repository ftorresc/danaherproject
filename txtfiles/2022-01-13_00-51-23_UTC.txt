Yep - I’m in trouble: There are times for all of us when we screw up and an opponent gets an imposing position that has us 100% defensive. First reaction? Mentally - don’t panic. There is not a single instance in history of a bad situation being made better by people panicking - so don’t. Physically - contract your body so you don’t leave any loose ends out for an opponent to make a bad situation worse. REPLACE PANIC WITH RESOLVE AND MAKE YOUR FIRST RESOLUTION TO NEVER GIVE UP AN EASY WIN TO AN OPPONENT - CONTRACT YIUR LIMBS IN TIGHT AND INSIDE YOUR OPPONENTS LIMBS. If this guy is going to beat you it’s because he EARNED his victory not because you gave it to him for free. Get those two reactions - one mental and one physical and you’ll do better than most in a bad situation next time you’re in one
