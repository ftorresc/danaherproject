Extreme pressure: Garry Tonon locks up a very tight inverted heel hook from cross ashi garami on the great Rousimar Palhares, himself a master of leg locks. The pressure of top level competition shows as Mr Palhraes grimaces and prepares himself to roll out of bounds to get a release- good tactical strategy on his part and showing excellent awareness of the geography of  the mat - a key factor in world championship level grappling. Note the physical tightness of Mr Tonon's ashi garami - very necessary against such a powerful and skilled opponent. This was truly a clash to determine leg lock supremacy in the grappling world
