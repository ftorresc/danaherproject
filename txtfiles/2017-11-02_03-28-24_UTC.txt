Counting down - the inversion of discipline: Georges St-Pierre and the team, Firas Zahabi, Freddie Roach, Jorges Blanco, Gordon Ryan, Phil Nurse, Erik Owings and myself get final preparation done in midtown Manhattan. Normally the challenge for athletes is to possess the discipline to get to the gym and train hard. In fight week there is a total inversion of discipline - now the discipline is required not to work out hard - BUT TO STOP YOURSELF FROM WORKING OUT HARD SO THAT YOU FOCUS ON LEAVING EVERYTHING YOU HAVE FOR THE CAGE RATHER THAN EXPENDING YOURSELF IN THE GYM. Just a light sweat, reinforcing the themes of the camp - the athlete has to be stopped from going too hard now. Now it’s light dinner time and then sleep and weight loss tomorrow - wishing you all the best from NYC and looking forward to the show at Madison Square Garden - America’s traditional home to combat sports.
