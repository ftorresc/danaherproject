Back in the blue basement: Great to see outstanding Australian grappling sensation Craig Jones @craigjonesbjj back training with the squad in preparation for his upcoming super fight in the upcoming @kasaigrappling show in NYC against leg locking powerhouse Rousimar Palhares. Senior squad member Garry Tonon had an epic match against the Brazilian juggernaut that showcased the leg lock game probably better than any other match. Mr Tonon did it weighing only 168 pounds that night in England. What better place for Mr Jones to prepare for the same challenge than the basement of hope and despair at RGA? This should be a fascinating match up. Mr Jones has a much bigger and longer body than Mr Tonon so there will be both differences and similarities in the preparation- should be extremely interesting. Today he mixed it up with the squad juniors in some great training. Here, he and Oliver Taza get into a great sparring session and exchange attacks. Next few months has a slew of tournaments with various rule sets to make for very interesting training sessions
