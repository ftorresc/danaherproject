Counting down: Final days now before the ADCC World Championships here in Anaheim California. The nature of training now is very different from earlier in the camp. Now itâ€™s about tactics rehearsals and general movement and weight management rather than hard sparring. Here, Gordon Ryan and the squad go through our pre match drills. Keeping an eye on intensity levels is important now - itâ€™s analogous to the difference between SHARPENING the edge of a knife - where the idea is to remove metal and change its edge geometry to a narrower edge - vs POLISHING the edge of a knife - a less radical action where the edge is gently smoothed down to make a refined cut. All the athletes here in Anaheim are in this polishing phase now. Today and tomorrow the process will go into the final phase of weight management - never a fun experience ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ Wishing you all the best from California!
