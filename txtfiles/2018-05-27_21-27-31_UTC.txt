When the day is done: The re-filming of the instructional video BACK ATTACKS: ENTER THE SYSTEM is done - two long days of filming covering all the main features that my brilliant students have had so much success with over the years. Now it’s back on the train to NYC and get ready for teaching tomorrow. There is a sense in which our day is never really done - it’s just preparation for tomorrow. The important thing is always to keep a sense of progression, so that the lessons of today make us wake up tomorrow a person better skilled to deal with whatever challenges the new day should bring.
