Conversation: I had the great pleasure of a conversational podcast with Lex Fridman and my two great students Georges St Pierre and Gordon Ryan. Mr Fridman went through some great questions on sports performance and greatness and Mr Ryan and Mr St Pierre have some brilliant replies. We chatted for over three hours on everything from Jiu jitsu to mma to animal combat to alien life ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ It was a truly great honor me to work with these two kings of their respective sports for so many years and it was a joy to reflect on it all in conversation with Lex. The podcast should be released pretty soon - hope you all enjoy it!!
