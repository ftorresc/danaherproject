Having fun training Shane McMahon of the WWE @wwe @shanemcmahonwwe - he is an outstanding athlete and shocked us with the speed with which he picked up complex moves! I have always loved reading about the old time link between Pro Wrestling and submission grappling. Many of the old time pro wrestlers were excellent grapplers who could do choreographed shows and real matches with equal efficacy. There was a much smaller gap between choreographed matches and real matches in those days. Mr McMahon is exploring that area now - learning the submissions we use and doing a fine job picking up strangleholds and joint locks! These big men move incredibly well for their size and are masters of stunt work, high amplitude falls and slams and showmanship - I am confident they could learn to slap on submission holds with style in a short time too!
