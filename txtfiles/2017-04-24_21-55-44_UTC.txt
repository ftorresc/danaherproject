Kohai keep pushing forward: Kohai (junior) student, Oliver Taza had another outstanding performance at the Sapateiro Invitational event this weekend. He has four bouts - won all four by submission- including an impressive leg lock victory over EBI standout Josh Hayden. This was a real test test for Mr Taza, as he is a welterweight, but the event was for 195 pounders so he was a small competitor. This is exactly the kind of harsh tests the kohai must seek - it will give them the tough competition experience that is so valuable when fighting at the next level. "Onwards and upwards" is the ethos in which the kohai must imbue themselves - that is exactly what Mr Taza is doing and that is why future success will come to him.
