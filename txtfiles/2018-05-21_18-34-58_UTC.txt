Victory for the Bronx Bombers: Those of you who have been following me for a while will know that every Monday night I travel up to the Bronx to teach at the academy of one of my first and best black belts, Doug Pelinkovic, who runs his own excellent academy @bxmartialarts Originally I started going there when Mr Pelinkovic was badly injured and saw the dedication of the students and stayed on after! Now fully recovered, Mr Pelinkovic does a very fine job of teaching his students our approach to the game. This last Friday night his extremely talented student, Stanley Rosa @stanleyrosa put on a superb display of submission directed jiu jitsu. Mr Rosa has built a tremendous game in a shockingly short time that is testimony to his hard work and learning capacity; and the teaching skill of Mr Pelinkovic. He has a distinctive movement style - like a leopard - that when combined with the mechanical tightness of our approach catches everyoneâ€™s eye. Enjoy this excellent display from over the weekend. Tonight I head up to see the Bronx team and hear the full story.
