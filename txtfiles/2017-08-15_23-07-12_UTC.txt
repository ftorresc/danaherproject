On the road again: Back at JFK airport, headed to London for Polaris grappling featuring Oliver Taza, Jake Shields and Garry Tonon taking on tough opponents on the other side of the Atlantic. Note to all - NEVER allow Garry Tonon to book your airline tickets - EVER - I have been booked into a four hour wait at exciting Manchester airport before connecting to London ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜£#ihopedillonbreaksyourlegandstranglesyougarrytonon.  It's been a while since we were in Old Blighty (England) - looking forward to seeing everyone. The squad has been training hard and looking to show our brand of grappling to our English fans. Ironically as I leave NYC we have some classic grey London weather! Hopefully it's sunny NYC summer weather in London ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Šgetting ready to take off now - see you in England!
