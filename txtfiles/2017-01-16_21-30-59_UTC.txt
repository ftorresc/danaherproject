There's no place like Renzo's: Monday afternoon Martin Luthor King day in NYC. The squad is preparing for upcoming events. Submission Underground Event - run by MMA legend Chael Sonnen will feature Garry Tonon against MMA super star Hector Lombard, who has world championship level judo skills and a huge size and strength advantage over Mr Tonon. Gordon Ryan will take on Jeff Monson, the former ADCC grappling world champion, again at a big size and strength disadvantage. It will be a classic match up of strength vs mobility for both of our athletes. Filming the athletes in training and conducting interviews afterwards, the Submission Underground crew had a busy day at RGA. ðŸ˜Š It's great to see MMA superstars promoting and competing in these events and using the star power of the MMA game to help grow the grappling game and give our athletes a venue to show our philosophy and methods in the sport. Thank you to Mr Sonnen and the SUG team from RGA and the squad.  The rule set will feature shortened EBI matches of eight minutes and then into overtime. Our training has to reflect the higher work rate required by the time constraints - leading to some spectacular matches on the gym floor today! Some of the practice matches could easily have been used as pay per view material!! ðŸ˜ƒðŸ¤•ðŸ˜œ With over seventy five people in the class it made for an exciting afternoons training...
