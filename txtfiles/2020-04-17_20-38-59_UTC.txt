Strangers: One of the most valuable training tools you have is a stranger. The overwhelming majority of our training is done with people we know pretty well. This is good, as their constant progress alongside us forces adaptation and growth if we are to stay abreast of them. However, every so often you get chances to train with someone you’ve never trained with before, and this can be a very positive learning experience. They will move in unfamiliar ways, employing techniques differently from you and sometimes use techniques you have never seen before. This forces you to think and improvise on the spot - one of the more difficult feats of combat sports. So when the opportunity arises to train with someone that is not part of your regular circle (and of course, they seem to be a safe training partner) - take it - it’s the best way to test your ability to instantly adapt to new challenges. Here, Garry Tonon and Gordon train with strangers shortly before a grappling tournament in England early in their careers. The same need to adapt and improvise to an unknown challenge will be required to an even greater degree in competition.
