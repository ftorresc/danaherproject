Counting down in Austin, Texas: Nicky Ryan and Ethan Crelinsten will take on exceptionally tough opponents tomorrow night at the WNO Grappling show on @flograppling Mr Ryan will take on the very formidable PJ Barch who combines a D1 Wrestling pedigree with black belt Jiu jitsu to form a very dangerous hybrid game matched with his impressive physicality. Mr Barch has a been a very tough rival for the squad for a long time with standout performances in the classic EBI shows when the squad began! Ethan Crelinsten will rematch the brilliant ATOS prodigy Cade Ruatolo who forms one half of the powerful Ruatolo brothers - they have also been powerful adversaries of the squad with wins for both sides. They have a brilliant and dynamic game with tremendous endurance and a cracking pace. Everyone has weighed in successfully and now just light workout tonight and all action tomorrow night! Hope you enjoy the show!
