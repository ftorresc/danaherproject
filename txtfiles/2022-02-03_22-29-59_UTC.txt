Getting under opponents: When it’s time to fight underneath an opponent it’s natural to want to keep their weight as far away from you as possible. This can certainly be an effective tactic, but there is much to be said for the opposite approach - IF YOU ARE GOING TO FIGHT UNDERNEATH SOMEONE, THEN GET AS FAR UNDER THEM AS YOU CAN. The advantage of this is that you can get under their center of gravity and LIFT people, and if you can get that incredible feeling of of effortless lifting that comes with good positioning under their center of gravity - you can make even the heaviest people feel light. That’s when the most beautiful sweeps in Jiu jitsu become possible and you can whip an opponent over and take top position in style
