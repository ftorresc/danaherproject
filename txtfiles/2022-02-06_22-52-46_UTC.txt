Jiu jitsu in a nutshell: Sometimes itâ€™s very helpful to have a simple set of instructions that can cover a lot of complex ground and give you a clear sense of direction when complexity makes things foggy. For me, Jiu jitsu always comes down to three major directives 
1 - When in bottom position always strive to keep your legs (guard) between you and your opponent 
2 - When in top position always strive to get past your opponents legs (guard) and into upper body pins. 
3 - Always seek to get behind your opponent whenever possible. 
  These simple rules express the main tactical desiderata of Jiu jitsu. Almost all the myriad techniques of the game are just a means to these ends. In time you will learn exceptions to these rules. You will learn to exploit an opponents overly strict adherence to them; but at the start of your journey they are the compass that will give you good direction in the chaos and confusion of sparring. In some ways the game is very complex, but at its core it is very simple. You can learn these three simple rules in less than a minute and they can guide you for a lifetime
