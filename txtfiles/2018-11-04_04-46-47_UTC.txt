Big win for Ethan Crelinsten at North American ADCC trials today: A superb performance today by Ethan Crelinsten to win gold at ADCC trials. I will have to check with Tom DeBlass but I think this may have been the largest number of entrants for a weight division in trials history! At the end of the day Mr Crelinsten was the only undefeated contestant - winning all matches except the final by submission - an incredible performance by this young man. Gordon Ryan did a fine job cornering him and other junior athletes for a great days work by these talented youngsters!
