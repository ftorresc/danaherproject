Heels or toes? A lot of what determines the effectiveness of a given move is unseen by bystanders. This gives rise to the notion of “invisible Jiu Jitsu” which captures well the idea that the success or failure of moves sometimes can’t be seen by spectators. One of the most significant determinants of whether certain moves will work is our opponents weight distribution - in particular, whether his weight is currently located on his heels or toes. The difference may well be invisible to an onlooker but it is of great importance to the action. When the weight is on the heels, sweeps and takedowns to the rear will prove highly effective with minimal effort. When the weight is on the toes, sweeps and takedowns to the front will work very well. Trying to force a rear sweep/takedown when the opponents weight is on the toes takes a lot of effort and will likely end in failure. As you rise in experience you will soon learn that you can manipulate an opponents weight on to toes or heels as you desire. When you want weight on the toes, push, and as the opponents resists and pushes back, his weight will gravitate to the toes - just as you desired. Here, Gordon Ryan senses an opponents weight is momentarily on the heels and immediately takes advantage with one of his favorite sweeps to the rear!
