Ashi garami in Mexico City: I had the pleasure of teaching our leg lock system at my old friend, Mario Delgado's school here in Mexico City. Great to see students quickly understanding and appreciating the core principles and techniques in a new venue. Now it's on to the arena for EBI 10, where Eddie Cummings will showcase many of those principles and techniques as he and the other squad members have done so often before. Going from the classroom to the stage is always a thrill - even more so tonight in new territory and new atmosphere ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
