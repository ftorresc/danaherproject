The general nature of Jiu jitsu is that of climbing the body to the hips and head: All Jiu jitsu is based on connection - no physical connection means no Jiu jitsu. The goal of Jiu jitsu is control. The best part of the body to control is the head with the hips a close second. Nonetheless is very difficult and even hazardous to attempt to start by connecting directly to the head and hips. The great pattern of Jiu jitsu is to begin with the extremities and work methodically up to the hips and then the head - like climbing - you donâ€™t begin at the peak - you start at the base and work your way up. In Jiu jitsu you begin at the wrists and ankles and work up to the elbows and knees, from there to the waist/hips and from there to the head. Think about passing guard. Contact usually begins with your hands on an opponents ankles, then closing distance and gripping a knee, then battling forward and getting to the hips and from there battling up to chest to chest position and capturing the head to solidify the pin. This general pattern of climbing from the extremities to the waist and head is the eternal pattern of Jiu jitsu - it must become the pattern of your thinking and acting in the sport and in your training and in your mindset. Like all things in life there are rarely shortcuts to the final destination you seek - climb methodically and be prepared to start again every time you fail - your patience in observing this basic feature of Jiu jitsu will be rewarded
