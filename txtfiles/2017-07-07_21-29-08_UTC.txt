Double Impact: Here is a remarkable case of twin turbo action - two of my favorite black belts - The St-Leger twins, Garry @gstleger and Harry @harrystleger They are not just biological twins, they are both double blackbelts in Judo and BJJ. Both competed in the world championships in Judo for the United States and have incredible skills in the standing position; but when the action hits the floor, the BJJ kicks in - now THAT'S double impact! These two tatami monsters were a huge part of one of the very best fight camps I ever participated in, when Chris Weidman prepared to take on Anderson Silva and win the UFC middleweight title. Their tremendous clinch, fence wrestling and ground skills were invaluable. Now Harry is an assistant coach at my old comrade Greg Jackson's gym in New Mexico. Garry lives in NYC and often assists me in daily teaching when my current physical problems make certain moves impossible. I have always been a strong advocate of blending standing skills (tachi waza) with ground skills (ne waza). These two outstanding athletes are tremendous examples of this. Recently Harry returned to the big apple to share some mat time with the squad and his brother for double the fun! I always tell my students, jiu jitsu is ne waza focused, thus most of our training time is on the floor, but you should at least be competent in the standing position. Our watchword is "killers on the ground and competent on the feet." These two over achievers went further and are killers in both domains!
