Different arm bar - different priorities: Probably the most basic difference in the execution of arm bars (juji gatame) is that between arm bars performed from bottom positions and those performed from top positions. The fundamental emphasis in each is substantially different. In the case of juji gatame from any given TOP position our primary emphasis must be upon KEEPING OUR OPPONENTS HEAD DOWN, whereas in the case of juji gatame from bottom position our primary focus is on KEEPING OUR HIPS UP HIGH to our opponent’s shoulder. This difference in primary focus creates a very different feel for one move in two different applications. In order to maximize your effectiveness with the move overall, you must be mindful of different priorities in different applications. When underneath - work hard to get your hips rising up off the floor and chase your opponent’s shoulder. You will soon notice an increase in your finishing percentages with this great move
