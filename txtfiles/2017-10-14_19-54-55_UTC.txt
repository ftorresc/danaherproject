Great day at Renzo Gracie Academy charity seminar: The squad came out to support one of our academyâ€™s great characters, Shy Aces. Gordon Ryan, Garry Tonon and myself taught a seminar featuring some key elements of our approach to the game. The students did a fine job of absorbing a lot of information and some difficult moves and by the end looked like a worthy gang of leg locking fiends! Thanks so much to everyone who attended - hope you enjoyed the lessons - keep experimenting with what you learned and growth and expertise will inevitably come.
