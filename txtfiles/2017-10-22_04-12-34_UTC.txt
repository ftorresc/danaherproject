Teaching in California: The squad had a great day of teaching in LA today. I had the pleasure of teaching at the dojo of my great friend Shawn Williams @5starmartialarts  It was great to see the Californians are really improving in the leg lock game! Mr Williams students along with some talented visitors went through some of our counter attack game and did a very fine job assimilating difficult material and made it work well. There is no doubt in my mind that the overall level of submission grappling is improving around the nation as I observe it in my teaching and traveling. Mr Williams and I talked at length afterwards about emerging trends in contemporary jiu jitsu, he has some fascinating views on this topic which I am sure he will talk about when he commentates for big jiu jitsu events in the future. Afterwards Mr Tonon went through his final workout for EBI 13 tomorrow night at the Orpheum in Downtown LA. He is looking very sharp and lean for this 155 pound event. Now it’s back to the hotel room to map out the remainder of Georges St-Pierre’s grappling training for the UFC show on November 4. Wishing you all the best from LA!
