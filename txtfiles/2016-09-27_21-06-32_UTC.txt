The indirect path: We work in a sport where we are actively trying to defeat someone who is actively trying to defeat us. This almost always creates a mindset in both athletes to go as fast and directly as possible to their respective goals. The problem is that both athletes usually have a good idea of what the goals of the other are. As a result, we run into a wall of defense and get shut out. Often you will get much better results if you employ an indirect path to your objectives - here is a general rule which I work hard to instill in all my students, the law of direction - the more sophisticated and knowledgeable your opponent, the more you will be required to choose the indirect route to your real objectives - The less sophisticated and knowledgeable your opponent, the simpler and more direct your attacks should be. Only when your real intent is masked behind fakery and deception will you pass through the defenses of an astute opponent. Now reading and saying this is easy; but performing in this manner whilst being vigorously attacked by a dangerous opponent is quite another. Very few people ever achieve the nerve, subtlety and patience to carry it out in a combative situation. If you can however, the rewards can be tremendous, as creating confusion and misdirection will make it far easier to execute your favorite moves in the heat of competition. Of all my students, none surpassed the subtlety, patience and indirectness of Georges St-Pierre in the set ups to his favorite move - the double leg takedown. People usually remember and admire his strong driving finish to the double leg. Very few ever comprehended the subtle indirect set ups that enabled him to get to that move on all comers for over over a decade. Here, Mr St-Pierre gives one of his strongest rivals, Josh Koscheck, multi time NCAA wrestling champion, some serious air time in the second match in Montreal.
