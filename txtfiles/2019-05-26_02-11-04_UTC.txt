Victory for Nicky Ryan!! Nicky Ryan @nickyryanbjj won his title match against the great Urijah Faber tonight in England. It was a very tough and physical battle that went the distance. Mr Ryan got one very tight entry into one of his favorite leg lock positions but went out of bounds before it could be completed and the adjustments made to restart the position appeared to loosen it so there was not a decisive finish. It was Mr Ryan who did all the engaging and attacking while Mr Faber played a very defensive game based on physical roughhousing and defensive positioning so the decision was an easy one for the judges. At the same event standout junior heavyweight squad member @nickyrod247 won via strangle from the back to show his impressive development in a very short time frame. Big thanks to @garrytonon for going out to England with the juniors to coach after his recent tremendous win in @onechampionship Itâ€™s wonderful to see the development of these outstanding young athletes as they battle towards their goals and dreams. Now everyone comes back to the basement and gets ready for the next big challenge! ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ
