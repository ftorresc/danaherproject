To the winner go the spoils: Kohai student Jonathan "JC" Calestine put on his best competition display yet today, winning the 145 pound division of The Finishers Tournament 3 - a popular local event. It included outstanding local grapplers such as JM Holland, Mike Davila and John Battle, but JC was able to get past them all to win the first place honors. JC has always looked good in the gym - Eddie Cummings often insists that I match him with JC as often as possible when he is preparing for big events as he believes JC is the most difficult among the Kohai to finish. Today he was able to let his gym skills shine on the stage and gain victory - with many more to follow I am sure. Great work JC and great work by the shows organizers for drawing such strong local talent into an event that provides ideal training for those looking to gain the kind of experience they will need to rise to the top.
