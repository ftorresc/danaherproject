Danger zones and safe zones: Any time you pass through dangerous territory you would never stop in an area that appeared even more dangerous than usual, rather, you’d keep moving until you came across an area that appeared less dangerous, only then would you take a break, reorganize and plot your next move. Jiu jitsu is no different. There are some positions relative to your opponent that are just too dangerous to stop and take a break. There are others that are safe enough to take a temporary respite and use some time to make a good next move. How safe these areas really are will vary. Really dominant positions such as rear mount give you great opportunities to really slow things down and consider your options. More often the safety zones are not that safe - they just take away the immediate threat. Here, Brian Glick steps off line to get away from the immediate threat from Gordon Ryan’s very dangerous guard. He has stepped out of a danger zone (directly in front of the legs) to a zone thats offers a very temporary safety - he will have to move quickly from here if he is to advance to greater safety and prevent being put right back into the danger zone. Make your early movements when you first engage away from immediate danger zones and work progressively through the various safety zones and you’ll be able to focus more on offense and get less distractions from having to fend off your opponents attacks.
