Merry Christmas from the squad and NYC!! 😊😊☃🍰🍧😊😊 Today was a relaxed day of training for the squad - focus was more on technical development and sparring in a relaxed manner. This idea of variable intensity is critical to long term training. Not every session can be a war. Big holidays give a great opportunity to reinforce this idea to the athletes. I love to see athletes train every day, but not to see them train as hard as possible every day - that quickly leads to breakdowns. Improvement is measured in months and years, not days and weeks, so it is critical to be able train effectively over long periods. A huge part of this involves variation in intensity levels of daily training so that every day can represent a step forward and as few days as possible are lost to attrition and injury. Now that work is done - it's time to eat - something the squad does very well 😜😜 Merry Christmas to you all from NYC!!
