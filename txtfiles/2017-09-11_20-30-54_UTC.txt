Mixing things up: Great training in the Monday afternoon class in the blue dungeon today as two different directions of grappling training took place alongside each other. The squad got ready for ADCC grappling world championships while Georges St-Pierre got ready for his MMA fight on November 4 in the UFC. It's always a fun and challenging coaching experience to look for the common ground between them and also emphasize the important differences in ways that help prepare the athletes for very different challenges. Somewhere in between the takedowns, the positional advantages and the submissions are the answers for both. Great to see old rivals Georges St-Pierre @georgesstpierre and Jake Shields @jakeshields getting each other strong for upcoming challenges. The Ryan Brothers @gordonlovesjiujitsu @nickyryanbjj continue to amaze me with their progress. Garry Tonon @garrytonon has been electrifying the training room lately with his skills. Wonderful to see my great friend Shawn Williams @shawnwilliamsbjj back on his hometown mats at RGA ðŸ˜Šalong with the very talented wrestler Kyle Cerminara. What a room! Always great to see the fine balance of competition and cooperation between athletes, friends and training partners that is the core of fighting to the top in sports and in life.
