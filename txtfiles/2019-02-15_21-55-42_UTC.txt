If your submission game is strong, it does not matter how far behind on points you are, how tired, beat up and demoralized you are - as long as you have a heartbeat and time left on the clock - you can win. For a grappler, submissions play the same role that a knock out punch does for a boxer - they make you dangerous at all times in a match no matter what the circumstances. Photo @jeffreyschu
