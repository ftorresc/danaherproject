High altitude action this weekend: This Friday, May 12 in Colorado, the Ryan brothers step up to compete again at Fight2Win Pro 34 in super fight action. The format will be ten minutes of Action and a decision based on submission danger and positional control should it go the distance. Nicky Ryan will take on talented local purple belt Derek Alumbaugh and Gordon Ryan will headline against the extremely talented and tough Eliot Kelly. Mr Kelly has a long resume of high level success. He mixes wrestling and jiu jitsu into a winning blend that has seen him win at the highest levels in both gi and no gi competition. He is ADCC American trials winner from last year and has repeatedly won world championships in a range of belt and age categories, beating legends such as Xande Ribeiro along the way. He fights at super heavyweight - Mr Ryan's best weight is at welterweight, but he has worked hard to gain weight and has finally broken the 200 pounds barrier to try to narrow the size gap with some of his future rivals. Fight2Win continues to grow as a venue for developing athletes around the nation and combines fast pacing of matches throughout the event, good atmosphere, some all American razzle dazzle and high level super fights to create interest. Both Ryan brothers have trained very diligently indeed and are now working to adjust to rare mountain air of Denver. Should be a great show!
