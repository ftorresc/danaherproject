First night in Austin Texas! I flew into Austin this afternoon and went to teach at Renzo Gracie Austin tonight. It was fun going over back control techniques and tactics with an enthusiastic group of locals ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ We will be teaching there while we get situated and organized and build our own place. Iâ€™ve always been impressed by the way change creates new outlooks and evolution in all of us - Iâ€™m sure the change will be a good thing and create a strong future. Tomorrow morning itâ€™s back to the mats for more!
