Travel: I am well known for my incompetence in many areas, none more so than travel. My poor students will attest to my miserable record of missed flights, missed connections, lost luggage - pretty much every error possible in an airport/plane. #airportloser Every time I head out to JFK airport, there is some freak car accident, thunderstorm, flash flood, anything that will prevent easy passage to the airport. #theghostofameliaearhearthauntsme Tonight I made my way to the airport - preparing for leg lock seminar in Pittsburgh tomorrow. I decide that this time it will be different - this time I will be in time. Of course Friday night in summer time NYC, everyone leaves for the Hamptons, so traffic out of the city is terrible. I wisely decided to leave early to beat traffic. As soon as I leave, I get a text that my flight has been delayed two hours.  when we get to the highway, there is NO traffic at all. In twenty five years in NYC I have never seen this. When I get to JFK, the line at security is usually massive - tonight, barely a person there and I Get through in less than two minutes. Usually my metal hip replacement sets off the alarms and I have to get frisked and explain how someone my age has a metal hip - tonight they just waved me through. Just as I got through I get another text saying my flight is delayed another hour! Ha ha! The one time in my life I don't need to be on time and I get to JFK in record time! #godhatesme Hope I don't fall asleep in the seminar tomorrow! It's going to be a long night!! #airtravelismynemesis ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜žðŸ˜’looking for adventure in a very quiet and boring Friday night JFK ðŸ¤”
