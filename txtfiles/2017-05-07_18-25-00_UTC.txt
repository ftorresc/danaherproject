Kohai making waves in Texas: It was another great weekend for the squad kohai (apprentices). Jonathan Calestine and Ethan Crelinsten entered the Onnit invitational 4 event in Texas yesterday and both submitted all their opponents, including EBI standouts Ricky Lule and Sheridan Moran, along with an IBJJF brown belt no gi world champion, mostly with variations of heel hooks and toe holds. Mr Calestine has been improving greatly of late, with the characteristic long training time and strict focus upon refinement of techniques and tactics that the squad expects. Both of our athletes went all the way to the final where finally the two team mates had to take each other on. In the gym they are very evenly matched. On this occasion Mr Calestine prevailed with riding time advantage on OT to take a narrow victory. The mantra of our kohai is always "onward and upward" - that's the spirit that takes us all from apprentice to master. Great to see these two outstanding young athletes taking that spirit and weaving it into the fabric of their lives and goals.
