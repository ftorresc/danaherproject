Reflections on the nature of our sport: We work in a sport where if a single submission hold  is applied perfectly - the match is over. Yet if that same submission is applied 99% perfectly but the opponent escapes, it counts for nothing. A failed submission hold, no matter how close, is no more effective than a missed punch in a boxing match (this point does not apply to a well applied submission hold that is effective, but the opponent opts not to tap and is damaged but continues to fight - in these cases, it had a positive effect insofar as the opponent will be damaged and easier to defeat with subsequent attacks). This creates a demand upon us to have a very deep knowledge of a few match winning moves where we have total confidence in our ability to pull them off against even the strongest resistance, rather than superficial knowledge of many moves. As we saw, superficial knowledge of a move only allows us to INITIATE a move, but only deep knowledge allows us to COMPLETE a move - AND IT IS ONLY COMPLETED MOVES THAT WIN MATCHES. You will succeed or fail based not upon how many moves you can initiate, BUT HOW MANY YOU CAN COMPLETE AGAINST RESISTANCE. The surest way to be able to overcome resistance is to have deeper knowledge around a complex of moves and counters in a specific domain than your opponent does. Your training should reflect this fundamental fact about our sport. Here, Eddie Cummings shows his extraordinarily deep knowledge of the ashi garami position as he locks in a terrifyingly tight heel hook variation during his outstanding run to the finals of EBI 10. Note that these reflections pertain to the specific case of submissions - in other areas of the sport broad knowledge- even superficial knowledge- is necessary for success. Photo by Michael Plaster
