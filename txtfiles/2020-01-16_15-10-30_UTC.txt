Iâ€™m very happy to announce the release today of my latest instructional video GO FURTHER FASTER: OPEN GUARD. This covers the main skills and tactics you will need to excel at this crucial element of your Jiu Jitsu game. My students are well known for their deadly open guard game - here I teach the technique and tactics that underlies so much of their competition success. Open guard is the most exciting part of the bottom game and allows you to use all four of your limbs against an opponent who is often limited to using two against you and thus enables a skilled smaller opponent to take on and defeat larger opponents. Hope you enjoy it! If you are interested there is a link in my Instagram Bio
