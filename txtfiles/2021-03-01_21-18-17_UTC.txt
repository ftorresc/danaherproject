Getting under an opponents center of gravity is the key to any lifting throw or sweep: sweeps come in different forms - some are trips, some are like wrestling takedowns, some involve getting behind the opponent.  The biggest and most impressive looking sweeps are those where you get under an opponent and lift - these create amplitude and flip an opponent over straight to his back. Itâ€™s important to focus on two things. First, get under your opponent. Second, keep contact with the floor with the other foot and your same side shoulder so that you can create drive off the floor and create power out of your lifting position. When you can do this you can get the kind of amplitude you see Gordon Ryan exhibit here at the World Championships.
