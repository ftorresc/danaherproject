Another day, another room: I am a big believer in consistency in training. Most of your training should be in one room with a group of like minded people. Only in this way can a routine be established over time that can create skills that can produce great results. Nonetheless, any athlete must be able to perform anywhere and at any time. Thus it is good periodically to get out of your regular spot and train in a new place with new people. Very often a simple change in routine can get positive results. This becomes a necessity for professional athletes who must travel to compete. They must develop the adaptability to get a great workout with anyone in any room - that is a real skill in itself. Here, Garry Tonon trains in England at a Polaris event in a small town called Poole, where we showed up randomly last year and trained with some excited locals in their interestingly painted gym. The action must have been good because the entire room steamed up like an English mist!
