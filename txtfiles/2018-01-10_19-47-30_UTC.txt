Seminar in LA: This weekend I will be in Los Angeles teaching a seminar at Dynamixmma in Santa Monica at 4pm with friends Antoni Hardonk and Josh Fiore. Always a pleasure to get out West and show our methods. Also I will stop by my great friend, Shawn Williams 5Star martial arts academy on Sunday to teach, then on Monday talk to Mr Joe Rogan and friends on his podcast. Should be a busy but fun weekend!
