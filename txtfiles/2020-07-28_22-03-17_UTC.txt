Action in Texas this Friday: This weekend the worlds most exciting grappler, Garry Tonon, will take on one of his toughest rivals, the extremely talented physical specimen Dante Leon, for a rematch after their classic confrontation at ADCC 2019. Mr Leon stunned everyone at that event by defeating the great Lucas Lepri, a man who undoubtedly ranks among the greatest Jiu jitsu players of all time. Mr Leon has an exceptional mix of positional and submission skills, along with excellent takedowns and is known for his devastating guillotine. Last time these two met, Mr Tonon was able to win after a tough battle with his dangerous leg locking skills - but as anyone familiar with top level competition will tell you - the difference between winner and loser at that level on any given day is so close that in the great majority of cases the outcome could be very different if the same athletes competed against each other the next day. Mr Leon is a smart and tactical player and doubtless has worked hard to improve in all the areas that Mr Tonon was able to use successfully last time. Unfortunately Gordon Ryan and Craig Jones tested positive for covid and will have to delay their matches until quarantine and subsequent testing is complete - then of course they would need some amount of time to get prepared. They were excited to face two of the legendary gym ATOS Jiu Jitsuâ€™s most brilliant athletes, Lucas Barbosa and Ronaldo Junior - hopefully when medically cleared those matches can be rescheduled as they would have incredible for spectators. Looking forward to getting back to Texas! Hope you enjoy the show!
