Patience: They say that patience is a virtue. Normally we apply this wisdom in everyday life, but it applies in combat sports also. Experts in Jiu jitsu seem to be able to take their time whilst getting to their goals, while beginners are always in a rush. Interestingly those who take their time usually get to their destination, while those who rush to get there usually don’t. What’s the difference? Why can some people take their time and get to a destination while other race to get there and fail? The answer is CONTROL. When you can exert control over an opponents movement you can take your time doing want you want. When you can take your time you can problem solve, switch plans, see emerging opportunities - all the things that make you more successful. When you’re training next, consciously slow yourself down and focus on CONTROLLING the path to your goal rather than RACING there - in time you will be delighted at the results.
