Getting the gang back together: Big projects coming up with the challenges of multiple EBI's, special rule sets (for Garry Tonon in Florida in two weeks) and high profile superfight for Eddie Cummings (vs Geo Martinez) and Gordon Ryan who has just been matched against the great Claudio Callasans, current ADCC world champion and a very dangerous and skilled adversary. With all these great challenges, training is getting very interesting indeed. Here, the squad relaxes after another structured session designed to build the skills needed to prevail in the face of these big challenges.
