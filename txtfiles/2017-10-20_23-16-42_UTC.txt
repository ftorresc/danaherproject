Danaher airport curse continues: My propensity to run full speed into disaster at airports continues. Despite being early for the first time in my life to JFK, a major slowdown of the security boarding system combined with massive Friday night crowd created the longest lines I have seen in my twenty fives years in NYC. Then a long walk, a bus ride to a separate gate area followed by another long walk to furtherest extremity of terminal, a last sprint on crippled leg to gate and I was last person boarding with barely a minute to spare! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Somewhere in a past life I must have DEEPLY offended the gods of flight. A strange thing about the worlds greatest city - it is serviced by the worst three airports I have ever encountered. Perhaps they could go all the way and add burning hoops and scorpion trapdoors to make getting to ones plane an even greater challenge. #whydontothercitieshavethisproblem. Now itâ€™s on to LA to meet up with Messrs Tonon and Ryan to get ready for another big challenge in EBI 13 at our old home of the Orpheum theater. I shall teach a seminar tomorrow at my good friend and team mate, Shawn Williams at @5starmartialarts  It will be a pleasure to see our West Coast friends and fans again ðŸ˜Š See you all soon!
