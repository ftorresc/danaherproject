If you can extend a limb - you can break a limb: Good Jiu Jitsu players are always very wary of keeping their elbows and knees close to their torso. This makes it very difficult to apply joint locks to them. If you could get those elbows and knees moving out and away from the torso - the submissions would come a lot easier. One of the very best ways to do this from bottom position is Kuzushi (off balancing). We humans are hard wired to prioritize balance - so when we lose balance we get distracted from all other concerns as we try to right ourselves. Thatâ€™s all the opportunity you need to enter into your joint locks. When working from bottom position - ATTACK HIS BALANCE FIRST AND HIS LIMBS SECOND and watch your success rate increase.
