Getting ready: Garry Tonon is preparing for his third MMA bout for @onechampionship in Singapore November 9 against talented Korean MMA fighter Sung Jong Lee. Mr Tonon has been training hard in his new sport - so much new ground to cover but it’s a fascinating journey! Though there is much that is new, the core principles of unarmed combat are always the same - it’s just a matter of training new skills to express them differently in a new context. Always so much going on as everyone prepares for their upcoming matches in grappling, but MMA has a different flavor and asks more from the athlete in terms of breadth of skill. Looking forward to this final week of hard training in NYC and then back to Asia!
