I am very happy to announce the release today of the final volume of the GO FURTHER FASTER Jiu jitsu fundamentals series STRANGLES AND TURTLE BREAKDOWNS. I cover the 3x3 gi strangles system in which the three most high percentage gi strangles in the sport are applied in the three most important strangle scenarios to give you the match winning details and tactics that you will use every time you step on the mats in your Jiu jitsu career. There are a vast number of strangles in the gi, many are interesting and exotic, but Almost Ninety percent of the successful strangles in top level gi competition come from just three families of strangle - my recommendation is to focus the vast majority of your study and training on them. To paraphrase - “fear not the man who knows thousands of strangles - fear the man who knows the three best strangles and has practiced them thousands of times and knows every aspect of their successful application.” I also cover the closely related skill of turtle breakdowns, which obviously sets up many of the best strangle opportunities. If you are interested in boosting your performance with gi strangles and breaking down the toughest turtle defenses - check it out! I will post a link in my Instagram bio Know more - win more!
