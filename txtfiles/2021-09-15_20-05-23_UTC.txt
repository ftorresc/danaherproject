When you can get the upper body and the lower body facing in opposite directions, you will generally dominate the top passing, pinning and pressure game.

If you can control both AND make them face in opposite directions, you truly put an opponent under pressure and he will find it very difficult indeed to stop you advancing to your next objective.
