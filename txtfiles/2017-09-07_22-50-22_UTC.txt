Two different pairs of eyes will look at the same event and see two entirely different narratives: Whenever we look at some event unfold, there is an interpretive element where we fit the event into a story mold that allows us to make sense of it. This is an essential part of our human nature. Nonetheless, it can have a limiting effect where it makes us see certain things and completely ignore others. Sometimes those things we ignore are the very things we ought to be focusing upon. As such, it's always a healthy thing to consult other well informed and knowledgeable people's opinions or thoughts on a given subject/event that you are working on. At the very least they will often make you question your own view more thoroughly and in ways that help your project. In some cases they can save you from making potentially disastrous oversights - either way it's a usually a good thing. Very often I consult the views of my senior students and teachers and almost always find some profit in it. There is no need to do everything yourself at all times, and often there are dangers of oversight associated with such an approach. THE SKILL YOU WANT IS NOT SO MUCH SELF SUFFICIENCY, BUT THE ABILITY TO DISCERN VALUABLE INPUT FROM ALL RELEVANT SOURCES AND MESH THESE WITH YOUR OWN TO CREATE IMPROVEMENTS.
