Pre-contest warm ups: Getting an athlete ready for competition is a long process. In truth the outcome of the match is decided long before the day of competition by the respective preparation of the two contestants. The match itself is almost like a postscript to what has already transpired in the dojo, in prefight strategizing and in the minds of the combatants during those lonely moments of reflection and forethought prior to the bout. Here I help get Eddie Cummings ready for a match as he runs through last minute drills with Garry Tonon shortly before stepping out on stage where all of that preparation will be tested.
