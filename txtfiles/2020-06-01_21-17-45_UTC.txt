In Jiu Jitsu no single pin will be final: Pinning in Jiu Jitsu is very different from other grappling arts. In most styles of grappling a pin can end a match if held for a period of time - but not in Jiu jitsu. Pins never end a match in Jiu jitsu no matter how long you hold them. As such you can never hope to win by simply holding someone in place for extended periods of time. Add to this the simple fact that if your opponent is roughly the same size and skill level as you are he will invariably be capable of eventually escaping your best pin if given sufficient time. So in Jiu jitsu training to hold a single pin is not really the goal. Instead, the idea is to hold it long enough to score (around three seconds) and then to hold it long enough to tire and frustrate an opponent enough that as they try to escape you cause them to concede an opening that will let you either to move to a new pin and get more points or to a submission attempt. ONLY USING PINS IN COMBINATIONS SO THAT AS HE ATTEMPTS TO ESCAOE FROM ONE YOU SWITCH TO ANOTHER WILL ENABLE YOU TO HOLD DOMINANT POSITIONS FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME AGAINST STRONG RESISTANCE. Donâ€™t just think about holding him down with a single pin, but rather about FLOWING FROM ONE PIN TO ANOTHER AND SMOOTHLY BYPASSING HIS ESCAPES BY MOVING TO A NEW VARIATION OF THE SAME PIN OR A NEW PIN ALTOGETHER. You can only immobilize an opponent so long before eventually he gets out - focus primarily on the skill of moving AROUND resistance from one pin to another once you feel your original pin is becoming untenable. Dynamic movement will keep you in good position longer than squeezing someone from the same position as long as you can and at the same time will open up many submission opportunities so you can bridge the gap between position and submission
