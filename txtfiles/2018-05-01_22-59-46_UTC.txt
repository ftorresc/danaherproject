LA Bound! At Newark airport getting ready to fly with Gordon Ryan and crew for his debut match on ACB against the Vinny Magalhaes. This weekend I shall teach seminars at Shawn Williams dojo @5starmartialarts and also at @dynamixmma Hoping to see our LA fans and students and show elements of our game 😊😊Gordon Ryan is wearing a Gucci fanny pack that puts mine to shame 😞😞 I am crestfallen. As soon as he falls asleep it’s mine!! See you all in LA!
