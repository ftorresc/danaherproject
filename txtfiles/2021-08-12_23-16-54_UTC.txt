Sometimes skills carry over directly - sometimes they carry over indirectly: Sometimes you learn a skill that you can see the moment it is taught to you that it will be immediately applicable to your game. So for example, if you specialize in heel hooking and you learn a new and effective way of exposing a heel, you know that you’ll probably be able to apply it very soon and it will fit in very well with what you already do. Other times the skills are applicable, but in a much less direct way. Here, Georges St Pierre works on heel hooking skills in a format applicable to submission grappling - but of course, he is an mma fighter, not a submission grappler, so the skills learned in this rather artificial position won’t translate directly to the fight situations he normally finds himself in. Even more extreme are the many law enforcement and military personal I teach. Sport Jiu jitsu is very removed from the world in which they operate where there are no mats, weapons are normal, they are dressed in body armor with a full kit that greatly restricts movement. Still, the skills are useful - it just requires more thought about modification and appropriate application, if understanding what needs to be changed for the different environment, rule set (or total lack of rules) etc. There is a lot of useful knowledge out there that can benefit your game - just because it’s not immediately and directly applicable to your game doesn’t mean it can’t be beneficial in some less obvious way - keep an open mind and you may well find that an insight you gained can be applied to your situation in ways that increase your performance
