Big weekend for the squad: The squad heads back into action this weekend. Gordon Ryan, Nicky Rod and Nathalia Santoro will be in Texas at Third Coast grappling. Mr Ryan will take part in a Charity event Ten minute exhibition bout to raise money for We Defy @wedefyfoundation an organization for the care and rehabilitation of America’s wounded combat veterans. Mr Rodriguez is entered into an extremely tough tournament featuring some of the greatest athletes in Jiu jitsu such as Lucas “Hulk” Barbosa and Roberto “Cyborg” Abreau among others - this should be an incredible event! Ms Santoro is matched against tough local talent as she looks to gain more competition experience. On the other sides of the country, the Aussie Assassin, Craig Jones will take in ADCC rival Mason Fowler under EBI rules at Chael Sonnen’s SUG event. Last time was a tough match even for the inestimable Mr Jones as he had to dig deep into his ever growing submission repertoire and take a highlight reel win via his lethal guillotine - this time its a shorter match and with an overtime shoot out it will be a very tough test. It’s always great to see the squad on stage, even more so in these tough times for Jiu jitsu competition - hope you all enjoy the show!!
