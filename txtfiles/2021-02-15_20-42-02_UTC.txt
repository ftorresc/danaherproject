Class is never really over: Its natural when you’ve just finished a tough class to want to get the hell out of the dojo and head somewhere less strenuous. Note however, that the time immediately after class is probably the time when you have the most honest and realistic assessments of your ability and flaws as you still have the feelings of exasperation and frustration at failed moves and the memory of exactly what they were. There is no better time therefore to puzzle out the problems fighter there after class. Often my students come to me with problems right after a rough day of sparring. Sometimes I have answers based on my similar experiences from years ago - sometimes i don’t - that’s fine - then it’s time to experiment and figure it out. The feeling of finishing a tough workout is good, but the feeling of finishing a tough workout AND knowing what you need to do to perform better tomorrow is even better. Use that time immediately after class - it’s a great time for improvement.
