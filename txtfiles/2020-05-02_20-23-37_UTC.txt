Have a definite goal when you scramble: Scrambles are one of the most common scenarios in Jiu jitsu. Too often, scrambles degenerate into a situation where athletes are moving for the sale of moving, rather than towards a goal. As the pace and intensity of the scramble intensifies, so does fatigue and confusion, until you are left with a feeling of having done a lot of hard work with nothing to show for it. It’s important that you movement always be movement with DIRECTION. In a scramble it is often difficult to identify and choose a direction because it’s all happening so quickly. The four easiest and most readily available desirable outcomes are front headlock, Kimura, ashi garami and the back. When you first start of your scramble training, I recommend using the back as your primary goal since it scores both points and submissions (the other three score submissions but no points). It will give you a clear sense of direction no matter how confusing the scramble. In time you can add the other three, but initially - focus on the back. Next time you are whirling around the mat like a gi inside a clothes dryer, starting looking at your opponents back as your next stopping point - you will be pleasantly surprised at how just being mindful of that goal will make you arrive there!
