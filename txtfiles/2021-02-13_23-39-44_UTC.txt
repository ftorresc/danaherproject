Are you ready for the next move? If there is one certainty in Jiu jitsu it is that the majority of your attempted moves will fail. This is a simple reflection of the fact that your opponents know the same moves you do and also the counters. Given the prevalence of failure it is crucial that you have mapped out what to do the moment you feel that the move has failed and recovery is not possible. We all spend our Jiu jitsu lives seeking to achieve success, but in reality the smart way to approach things is to seek to recover and exploit failure since this is far more common than success. Here Nicky Ryan has lost control of his opponents knee - a clear sign that this heel hook/knee bar attempt has failed beyond recovery - the only question now is where to go from here. If you are asking the question now - itâ€™s already too late. You must train yourself to ask it before that critical moment.
