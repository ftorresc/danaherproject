Don’t be satisfied with the mere act of pinning - go the extra distance and isolate his limbs away from the torso: It’s good to get to a classic pinning position like mount, side or rear mount, but that won’t help much against a well trained and mentally tough opponent who knows his escapes. Once you get to a pin, the onus is one you to immediately work to get his arms separated from his torso so that you can 
1 - get even better control over your opponent by making escape considerably more difficult 
2 - make the task of dynamically shifting from one pin to another (the best way to score big points in Jiu Jitsu) much easier
3 - bridge the gap between position and submission by isolating a limb in a way that make submission far more likely than simply waiting for an opponent to make a mistake. 
Here, Nicky Rod amplifies the pulverizing pressure of his top mount game by separating his opponents elbow from his torso to make a transition from pin to submission much more likely. Make this a habit every time you get to a pin and you will immediately find you are much harder to escape from, move more easily from one pin to another, and score a lot more upper body submissions
