Teaching: Most of what I write about is about your goal of LEARNING Jiu jitsu. However, a big part of my approach to learning is getting my students involved in TEACHING. There is a great relationship between the acts of learning and teaching and as you progress in one you will inevitably improve at the other. I often get my students to teach moves back to me in class or to teach some innovation they have figured out. The act of teaching forces you to figure out the most important details and features of a technique. Asking yourself how to present the information makes you understand the technique more clearly. Presenting it in a way that is understandable for all levels makes you prioritize the most pertinent details. Obviously it’s easier to teach to others when you’ve reached a higher level in the sport, but start early. Start by teaching friends at the same level as you some aspect of the game you have researched and try it out together. Make adjustments in accordance with the problems you encounter. Just the act of asking the important questions and understanding the central problems involved around the technique can enhance your understanding. It works wonders for my students both as athletes and as teachers themselves. Teaching is a skill like any other, and, like any skill, the best people are usually those who start early and do it often. I started teaching when I was a blue belt in the late 1990’s. Nothing makes me happier as a teacher than seeing my students breakdown complex material and improve the understanding and knowledge of those who train around them. It makes everyone in the room part of a project and gives a whole new meaning to their training. Try it. Start small with friends and see how it can benefit your game.
