Chasing after the wind: There is an old cliche in the sport of boxing: Don't try to force a knock out - those that do almost always end up disappointed and quite often the victim of the very end they sought after. Exactly the same is true in jiu jitsu. Chasing directly after submissions feels like chasing after the wind ; those who do so usually fail to get what they so badly wanted. Rather than chase directly after submissions - CHASE THE PRECONDITIONS THAT MAKE SUBMISSIONS MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR. Once those preconditions are attained - THE SUBMISSIONS WILL COME. So often I see students take to heart our program of emphasizing submissions, but falter badly when they race directly for submissions. Their game takes on a scrappy and forced look that garners meager results. A much better approach is to always to ask yourself - WHAT ARE THE PREREQUISITES OF SUBMISSION? And FOCUS ON ATTAINING THOSE. Traditionally, jiu jitsu has always posited that POSITION is the prerequisite of submission. There is much truth to this. Our approach to jiu jitsu however, adds to this by emphasizing other prerequisites in addition to the traditional understanding of position. A deep study of this area will be of immeasurable value to your submissions percentages. Here kohai student Oliver Taza shows excellent  preparatory skills in preparation to submitting an opponent in a recent tournament.
