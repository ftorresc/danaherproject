Final phase: The last elements of preparation for Georges St-Pierre’s comeback bout on Saturday night began last night here in NYC at RGA. It was great watching him do pad drills with Freddy Roach, Firas Zahabi and Jorge, then grappling drills with Gordon Ryan. During the day, Garry Tonon and Mr Ryan are beginning their first steps in MMA training. It’s never easy to go from excellence in one sport to absolute beginner in another, but both men are enthusiastic and willing to put the time and study in - that alone gives me confidence they will make quick progress in this new skill set. Back to work teaching now. Mr St-Pierre has a public workout this afternoon and then a main workout tonight. The blade has already been sharpened - now it’s just final polishing to send him into the cage with an edge like a razor Saturday night.
