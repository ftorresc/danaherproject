Victory in Singapore!! Garry Tonon took a unanimous decision victory over a very game and dangerous title contender Koyomi Matsushima in Singapore. It has been more than a year since Mr Tonon fought due to circumstances and COVID-19. He was able to his extensive half guard bottom training done in this camp to advantage and take his opponents back to threaten strangles and take first round. Round 2 he showed his growing skill in integrating striking with takedowns to take the wrestler down and hold him down to again take the back. In the third round he landed a nice rear hand followed by knee to rock his opponent to take the bout very comfortably and get his MMA path back on track after the long layoff. Hope you all enjoyed the show!! Now Mr Tonon will join us in Puerto Rico and get back into training for the next challenge!! ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ
