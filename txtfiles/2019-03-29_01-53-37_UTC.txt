Old school in Tokyo! Wonderful meeting up with two true MMA legends and pioneers - both early heroes of mine from the early days of MMA all the way up to the present and into the future! @vitorbelfort and @caoluno These guys had so many thrilling matches over the years - can’t wait to see them do more in the future! They are here in Tokyo for the big @onechampionship event this weekend - it’s a great time to be in Japan! Legends like these fellows put MMA on the map - I can still vividly remember all their biggest fights from years ago and they are both in tremendous shape even now and ready to show that old school skills are still an incredible force in an ever changing sport! I must have watched their fights a thousand times - such an honor to meet them in person!
