Testing the limits of your game: We all have our limitations. What determines your level is just your capacity to find and expand those limits over time. Determining where those limits are currently set is the result of testing yourself in hard training - but expanding those limits is a question of spending time at the edge of your current skill level. It’s never a comfortable place to be and very often you go further than you can handle and fall - but it’s only there that growth occurs. Here, Gordon Ryan tests the limits of his defense with Georges St-Pierre. When you can stop worry about RESULTS of training today and instead start worrying about the EFFECTS of training five years from now - your growth will really begin.
