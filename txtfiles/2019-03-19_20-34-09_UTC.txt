Aussies in NYC: Team Australia is back training in NYC in the basement. Aussie grappling super star and overall nicest dude in grappling Craig Jones is here for the month in preparation for the big upcoming show at @kasaigrappling tournament featuring many of the best in the world such as Felipe Pena and Kaynan Duarte among others. Mr Jones has been training hard and continues to improve as he goes through a busy competition season leading up to world championships at ADCC this year.
