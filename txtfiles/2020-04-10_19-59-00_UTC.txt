Making first contact with your opponent - start with hands and head: All grappling requires contact with your opponent. When it’s time to initiate that contact it is almost always the case that we begin with HANDS and HEAD. You must get used to getting to your grips with your hands and establishing forehead to forehand contact. This will create situations where you have ENOUGH CONTACT WITH AN OPPONENT TO CREATE STRONG DEFENSE and at the same time, be close enough and with sufficient contact TO INITIATE OFFENSE WITH A HIGH PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS. Make a habit of making first contact with well placed hands and (gently) head and you’ll get off to a strong start every time!
