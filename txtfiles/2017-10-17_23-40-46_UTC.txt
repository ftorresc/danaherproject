Nothing beats a good day of training in preparation for a big show: Georges St-Pierre wraps up a strong day of training - he will need more like this to take on an adversary as tough as Michael Bisping. Working with grappling standouts Gordon Ryan and Garry Tonon is tough enough - to do it after a full kickboxing sparring workout shows the kind of drive and skill this remarkable athlete possesses. Tomorrow morning we fly back to the basement in NYC to train the rest of the squad and then itâ€™s off to LA to watch Mr Tonon compete in EBI 13. A hectic week, but the squad wouldnâ€™t have it any other way ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š Wishing you all the best
