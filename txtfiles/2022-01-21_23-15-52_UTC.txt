In a tough match against an opponent your own size and skill level you will probably get less than three opportunities to finish - your training must reflect this reality. As much as we like to learn new novelties and tricks, it must be understood that these are generally of use only when matched against easy opponents. In a tough match you will always be forced back to your most trusted weapons. MAKE SURE YOUR BEST WEAPONS ARE YOUR MAJOR FOCUS IN MATCH PREPARATION AND THAT YOU CONSTANTLY LOOK FOR WAYS TO IMPROVE YOUR PERFORMANCE OF THEM AND ADD NEW SET UPS, VARIATIONS AND FOLLOW UPS TO KEEP THEM EVOLVING. You will be judged NOT BY HOW MANY MOVES YOU KNOW, but rather by HOW MANY YOU CAN APPLY ON THE TOUGHEST OPPONENTS, and this number is quite small EVEN FOR THE BEST IN THE WORLD.
