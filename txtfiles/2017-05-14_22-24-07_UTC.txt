No rest for the kohai: The quest to rise in skill and prominence is a constant one for the apprentices of the squad. Ethan Crelinsten, squad kohai standout who just won the ADCC trials, went right back into competition yesterday at the 16 man 155 pound EBI format Global Grappling League. With $1000 on the line, many very talented local grapplers got in on the action. Mr Crelinsten emerged victorious again - winning every match by submissions ranging over the whole body - armlocks, strangles and leg locks. Here we see him using elements of our back system to strangle talented EBI standout (and former team mate) Mike Davila and get to the final. In the final he went against talented Brazilian black belt, Alexander Da Silva, who had done very well to get to the final. There he prevailed with a well applied knee bar (hiza gatame). A happy Mr Crelinsten celebrates with team mates and a thousand shekels for the pot! This busy schedule of training and competition builds a reservoir of knowledge and experience that will prove invaluable later in the athletes career. Photo #outrunthereaper
