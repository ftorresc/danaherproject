"Hi John, how is Gordon doing?" "Very well, Mom - in the finals, won everything so far by strangulation in regulation time." "Very nice, whose next?" "Vagner Rocha Mom." "Oh yes - he's tough. How is the match going?" "Very well, Mom - he's got Vagner's back already." "Ok, tell him to trap the defensive arm with a cross grip on the opposite side he fell towards." "Yes Mom." "Now, tell him to to get the index knuckle of the strangle hand to the point of Vagner's chin and work from there." "Yes Mom." What happened? What's that noise?" "Gordon just won, the crowd roared and Gordon screamed "Porra!" very loudly." "Alright, very good, well, don't forget to work your ashi drills before you go to sleep, clean the floor, brush your teeth and get a good nights sleep." "Yes Mom." ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜œðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ @allinphoto
