Meanwhile...back in the West: While Garry Tonon and Nicky Ryan have been preparing for upcoming challenges here in Thailand, Oliver Taza has been competing very successfully in the European Gi jiu jitsu circuit. Mr Taza has, like senior team mate, Gordon Ryan, been training a lot in the gi program in the blue basement and has ambitions in both gi and no gi. This week he entered the ACB European championships and won all four matches by submission to qualify for the ACB world championships later in the year. Here he shows excellent passing pressure to put himself in position to switch between Kimura and back systems to get the submission in the finals.
