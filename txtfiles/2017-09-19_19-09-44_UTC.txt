Sharpening the edge: The squad went through drills and sparring in Finland today and tonight. Everyone looking sharp as the days count down. Finland is a deeply impressive country - it reminds me a lot of the Southern parts of my old homeland, New Zealand. The people are extremely sensible, practical and extraordinarily well educated. All those I have met are multi lingual and well versed in world history and politics. Tomorrow we will go through another two sessions, joined just now by big Tom DeBlass who came of the plane plus a three hour train ride and straight on to the mats to put in great work - always an inspiration to the younger students ðŸ˜ŠIn between I will teach a seminar on leg locking to our Finnish hosts and fans at JKL Fight Club where we love to train. Now it's back home to plot and plan over some good local food ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠWishing you all well from Nordic Europe!
