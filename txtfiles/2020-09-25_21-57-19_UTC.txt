The two most significant rules in Jiu jitsu with regards the standing game:  There are two rules in Jiu jitsu that make the standing game significantly different from other grappling sports. The first is the THREE SECOND RULE which states that takedowns only score when they exhibit control for three seconds after the takedown where the opponents hips/buttocks/back or knee is kept on the floor for the full three seconds. This is a very difficult criteria to satisfy and in competition often means that the critical three seconds generates a scramble and points are scored in the scramble rather than the takedown per se. The second crucial rule is THE GROUND ENGAGEMENT RULE which states that if an athlete elects to sit to guard position the other athlete MUST engage on the ground. This means you can never force the opponent to a standing match - it has to be something they want to engage in. It is this rule which makes it possible for Jiu jitsu students to completely ignore standing skills (other than the easy skill of pulling guard) and makes it important for us to know how to counter a guard pull - a skill that is not necessary in other grappling arts that donâ€™t have this rule. All of your standing training training in Jiu jitsu has to factor in the effect of these two rules. Takedowns that would score in wrestling or Judo may not score at all in Jiu Jitsu and at any time you may have to abandon the standing game if an opponent sits to the floor. It is important that you adjust your techniques and tactics around these two unique rules of Jiu jitsu - they have a huge effect on the standing game in our sport
