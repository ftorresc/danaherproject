Making yourself strong is good - but making your opponent weak is far better: The human body is set up in such a way that it can be impressively strong in some postures/positions, and embarrassingly weak in others. Your job as a Jiu jitsu athlete is always to actively seek to put yourself in strong postures whilst pressuring your opponent into unnatural, weak postures where the body simply cannot exert strength. A classic example is putting an opponents hand behind his back. Show me a man with a strong arm and Iâ€™ll show you that same man with his arm pinned behind his back no longer has a strong arm. There are MANY cases where this simple concept can be applied to your advantage in Jiu Jitsu. Whenever you can get an opponents hand behind his back, you OWN that arm now. Seek always to make strong opponents weak by putting them into unnatural positions and you will make your task on the mat considerably easier.
