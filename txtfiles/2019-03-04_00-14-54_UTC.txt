ENTER THE SYSTEM is complete: Just finished a final last minute filming session for the final installment of the ENTER THE SYSTEM instructional video series - ARM LOCKS (juji gatame) These videos have a vast amount of material in them - I was curious to see if i could improve this latest one by adding a special feature at the start of the video where I taught an outline of the system so that viewers can get the big picture at the outset and then get all the crucial details in the heart of the video. We filmed it today at it came out really well! Now itâ€™s time to head back to NYC - thereâ€™s a big snow storm coming so this should be interesting! ðŸ˜œ Wishing you all the best and canâ€™t wait for this last ENTER THE SYSTEM video to get edited and released in a week or two!
