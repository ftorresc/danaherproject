When the body’s work is done, the mind’s work begins: At the end of each workout, it is crucial to spend time evaluating the sparring and assessing which skills were employed successfully and which were not. This kind of analysis is the key to making ONE WORKOUT BUILD UPON ANOTHER SO THAT OVER TIME FORWARD PROGRESS IS MADE. Improvement is only possible if the lessons of one session are applied in the next. This requires a clear articulation of what was working/failing and why it was working/failing and a plan of how to build upon success and overcome failure in the next session. Without that, one workout follows another with little sense of progression. Photo by @supersaiyanmagicalgirl
