Jiu jitsu is a series of exchanges that begin with contact and end with separation - these are repeated over time until there is a result. This is important; it means that every time you re-engage, there is a chance for advantage if you engage on your terms. If you start most of the engagements on your terms, you will probably prevail over time. Every time you break contact and come back to re-engage, come back with a plan and act quickly on it as you approach. Donâ€™t just lazily step towards the opponent and complacently come to grips. Have a sense how you will gain advantage from the moment of contact every time and you will steadily wear down even the toughest opponents
