Closed guard instructional video release! I am very happy to announce the release today of the latest chapter of my GO FURTHER FASTER - BJJ FUNDAMENTALS instructional video series - CLOSED GUARD. Closed guard is invariably the first position that Jiu Jitsu students are taught when working bottom game. It always figures heavily in competition and gym sparring success in Jiu Jitsu at all levels and in all weight categories both with and without the gi. Many great athletes have excelled at it and made it the foundation of their bottom game. The high hip position it offers makes it capable of being a devastating attacking position from underneath if used well. The main theme of this video is built around the idea that ostensibly closed guard is a NEUTRAL position - but if we can maneuver an opponent into one of six easily attainable vulnerabilities within closed guard - we can convert it to a DOMINANT position even whilst underneath a tough and knowledgeable opponent - and thatâ€™s when the fun begins! Though I am mostly known as a coach of high level athletes and technical innovations - nothing pleases me more than teaching the fundamentals of Jiu Jitsu - for without them none of the other material I teach would be effective. The fundamentals are the heart and soul of the game and closed guard is the most fundamental of the entire bottom game. Keep working your closed guard!! Thatâ€™s one position that will never go out of style ðŸ˜œ If you are interested in my video there is a link in my Instagram bio.
