Adjustments: submission holds are an all of nothing affair. A submission hold that was 99% perfect allows a skilled opponent to escape through that 1% error. A submission hold that was 99% perfect that failed scores nothing  LEARNING TO TAKE A MOVE FROM 95% PERFECT TO 100% PERFECT IS ONE OF THE GREAT KEYS TO YOUR PROGRESS. Most submissions begin with an entry that is far from perfect, but good enough to hold an opponent in place long enough for a PERIOD OF ADJUSTMENT that transforms the move into one capable of actually finishing a tough opponent. Learning to ADJUST UNDER PRESSURE is the mark of the submission expert - and it must become part of your game. Submissions START with entry - but they FINISH with adjustment. Take the time to adjust and convert them from decent to good and from good to great - this is the way of the submissions expert.
