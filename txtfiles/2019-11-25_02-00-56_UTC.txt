Heading back to NYC! Iâ€™m sad to leave beautiful Hawaii - this small Island group has a very strong Jiu Jitsu community and is an absolute pleasure to visit. It reminds me a lot of the land of my upbringing - New Zealand - both housed deep in the heart of the mighty Pacific Ocean - with Ocean breeze, sun sets and maritime air that I never see in NYC. Now itâ€™s time to return across the ocean to the big Apple. Some great upcoming projects with Gordon Ryan so itâ€™s back to the basement where the body and mind are tested and the spirit challenged and work fulfills dreams. Wishing you all the best from Hawaii. To my long suffering students - letâ€™s get ready for action! See you soon! ðŸ¤—ðŸ˜œ
