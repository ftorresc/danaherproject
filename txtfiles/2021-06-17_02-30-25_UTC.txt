It all begins with push and pull: Open guard is perhaps the most most quintessential modern Jiu jitsu position. It probably offers a wider array of potential attacks than any other position in the sport - but they all begin the same way - get a grip and engage in push and pull to break an opponents stance/balance and create a reaction. If you can reliably initiate the push/pull sequence at the onset of most engagements you will have the foundation of a great open guard. Next time you practice open guard focus first on the preliminary push and pull and your will find that as you improve in this regard, all the other moves you wanted to perform come easier
