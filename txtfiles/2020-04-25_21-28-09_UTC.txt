Train your mind to see and identify the next steps: People talk to me about SPEED in combat sports all the time. Don’t get me wrong - physical speed is a wonderful attribute to have and is extremely valuable in combat sports - but let me tell you this - THE MOST IMPORTANT SPEED IS YOUR SPEED OF SOUND DECISION MAKING. If you can make good decisions faster than your opponent you will appear faster than an opponent who is physically faster than you. Most actions begin with a decision. If you are making decisions faster than the other fellow you will have the advantage of a head start that can make up for slower physical actions. Of course the decisions themselves have to be good ones - idiotic decisions made quickly don’t help - but as they say, even a decent decision made in a timely fashion is better than a great decision made too late. When you watch people spar, don’t just watch for entertainment - watch to learn the mental skill of second by second decision making. Try to figure what they ought to be doing to each other as the action unfolds. You can do the same thing watching competition footage of athletes. This kind of mental training has direct ramifications for your physical game and will make you a better physical athlete next time you are sparring.
