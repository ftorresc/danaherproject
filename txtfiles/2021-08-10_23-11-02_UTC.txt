Tunnel vision: One of the most natural and destructive human tendencies we have in the mat is tunnel vision. When we have an objective in our mind there is a powerful tendency to shut our eyes to other possibilities which may well be more promising. One of my tasks as a coach is to call out those other possibilities as they arise. The choice is still in the hands of the athlete - but at least he or she now works with a CHOICE of options rather than only one - and in a world where selection is done in seconds and can impact the outcome - thatâ€™s an important thing. When you train there is always a voice there to open your peripheral vision - so train yourself to always have at least two options for every second by second moment of attack - you will immediately double your rate of success
