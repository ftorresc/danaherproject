Your first priority - defensive soundness: I am sure on many occasions you have seen two completely untrained people fight each other. The first thing you notice is that neither is concerned with defense but instead they are totally preoccupied with their offense. As a result the fight looks like it will be decided on a coin toss - whoever lands first will win. The first sign of expertise in combat sports is constant defensive awareness. GOOD FIGHTERS AND GRAPPLERS ALWAYS WORK ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT EVERY TIME THEY ATTACK THERE WILL BE IMMEDIATE COUNTER ATTACKS. As such they never enter into offense with an escape route and positioning that will either deny counter attacks or make them difficult. MAKE A HABIT OF DEFENSIVELY SOUND POSITIONING and you will remove the randomness of outcome that is the hallmark of untrained fighters and replace it with outcomes that heavily favor you. Enter, apply and finish every attack with defensively sound positioning and the outcome will be something you can count on rather than wish for
