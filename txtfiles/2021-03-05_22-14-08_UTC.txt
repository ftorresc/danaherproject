Priorities: Any time youâ€™re in a bad situation it is imperative that you prioritize the most most serious threats first and address them before the secondary threats. Any time you are in a bad spot in Jiu jitsu you will face multiple threats. Some will be more serious than others - make sure those are the first ones you address. Here, Gordon Ryan is in a critical situation. Because he is addressing the primary threat first (the strangle) he can remain calm and start making decisions as to how to deal with the secondary threat (the rear mount position). Bad position is already bad enough without making it even worse by mistakenly trying to deal with secondary threats before primary threats.
