What do the three most desired positions in Jiu jitsu have in common? The two most dominant positions in Jiu jitsu are mount and rear mount. The best position when underneath an opponent is guard. What do all three have in common? YOU CONTROL AN OPPONENTS HIPS AND TORSO BETWEEN YOUR KNEES. This allows an extraordinary amount of control and also the ever present opportunity for the best submissions in the sport. Make it a habit to line up with an opponent and control him between your knees. This fulfills the Jiu jitsu ideal of grappling an opponent with your legs first and upper body second.
