Catching heels, counting shekels: squad apprentice Jason Rau stepped up to take on four opponents on route to gold at Global Grappling Leagues 170 pound tournament yesterday - defeating all opponents by submission to take the prize money. Mr Rau has been training very hard - he suffered a severe rib injury and showed great fortitude in training through it and then competing despite limitations in mobility. The hard gym work paid off as he was able to get to his favorite moves, three heel hooks and an arm lock for the winners place on the podium. Here he relaxes with team mates Frank Rosenthal, who took bronze and Damien Anderson. Great to see the kohai (apprentice) students going out and winning local while dreaming international - that is the mindset we must all take on if we are to maximize our potential in the sport.
