Heading back to NYC: Sad to leave Texas. It was a great weekend with @gordonlovesjiujitsu giving one of his gutsiest performances to take tight victory that was fought down to the last seconds while carrying an injury. Today Mr Ryan and I taught an awesome seminar at @gracieonejiujitsu I did the demonstrations while an incapacitated Mr Ryan went through a great question and answer session with the attendees where he showed the tremendous depth of his knowledge in Jiu Jitsu and training. It was a real pleasure connecting with the Dallas Jiu Jitsu people and showing our way of doing things. Canâ€™t wait to come back to the Lone Star State. Congratulations to Mr Ryan and his great opponent JoÃ£o Gabriel Rocha for one of the best matches of the year. Congratulations also to @kasaigrappling for putting on another awesome show - these guys are taking grappling in all the right directions. And thank you to the fans in Texas and our gracious hosts here in Dallas who made it such a pleasure to come here and show some squad style Jiu Jitsu ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ Now Iâ€™m waiting at Dallas/Fort Worth for my flight back to NYC tomorrow I return to the basement - lots more goals to reach for all of us - letâ€™s get to work! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
