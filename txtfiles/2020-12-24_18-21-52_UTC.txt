From guard almost everything begins with an attack on the opponents balance: Here I am demonstrating a double leg entry into cross ashi garami. Note how it begins, as almost all attacks from guard so, as an attack on the opponents balance that forces hands to floor in reaction and then going from there. Your opponent canâ€™t ignore such an attack, his reaction and your preferences will determine the direction and choice of your response - but it all begins with balance.
