People often ask me which techniques they should focus on in training. My answer is simple. Ask yourself one question - IF YOU WERE IN THE FINALS OF THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS, IN THE TOUGHEST MATCH OF YOUR LIFE, WHICH TECHNIQUES FROM YOUR REPERTOIRE WOULD YOU BE USING? In all honesty it would be a rather small set of trusted moves wedded together in mutual support to get the win. Focus on THOSE moves if you want to maximize the effectiveness of your training time.
