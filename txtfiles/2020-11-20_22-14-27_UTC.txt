Articulate a broad vision first and then a sound means of getting there: When I teach my first job is to give people a sense of direction - what are we trying to accomplish? What is itâ€™s purpose? Why is this important? Then I try to fill in the myriad details of tactics and technique along with a training method that can actually allow a student to actually perform that vision in a competitive situation. In this sense I preach a teaching method based around PURPOSE and PATHWAY. Give students a sense a purpose and a pathway to get there. When you have a general sense of purpose it is so much easier to remember all the many techniques and tactics because you know what direction they are supposed to take you. Techniques that are not used regularly are soon forgotten. Details taught in isolation often seem frivolous and unnecessary. But when they are out in in the context of purpose they make a lot more sense and are retained a lot longer
