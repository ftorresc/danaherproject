Interfering hands: It always seems every time you go to hit a move from guard your opponents hands are always working to dislodge the grip of your legs and shit down your sweep attempt. Whenever this happens - attack his balance. If he doesn’t use his hands for balance he’ll fall. If he does release and use his hands for balance and base - he won’t be able to interfere with your guard and you can attack again. Don’t accept those disruptive hands. If he puts hands on your legs - knock him off balance immediately and play off his reaction to it.
