Many people go out on the stage THINKING they are going to win - only a few go out KNOWING they are going to win. Your job is to train in such a manner that over time you become  more like the latter and less like the former. Your first steps involve developing a clear understanding of all the means by which you could possibly lose a match and making it impossible for an opponent to make them happen. Once you know an opponent has no means of scoring on you - the act of winning becomes a lot easier.
