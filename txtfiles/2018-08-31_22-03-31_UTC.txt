On the road again: Heading to Reno Nevada out of JFK to teach a seminar at the school of long time friend and RGA colleague Max McGarr. It will be a crazy weekend for travel over Labor weekend ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ Great week of training for the junior squad members- they are doing such a fine job working towards their aspirations - thatâ€™s what it all about for all of us. When you have a free moment this weekend, take the time to set some goals, some short term, some medium term and some long term. Then ask yourself what will be required to make them happen. Even a small amount of time spent this way can have a vast impact on your future development- remember it not just about how hard you work - the world is full of people who worked extremely hard but achieved little. Itâ€™s about the marriage of hard work and intelligent planning that give DIRECTION to the work. Give it a try this weekend. Wishing you all the best! See you in Nevada! ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—
