All rational approaches to combat are founded upon the idea of creating an asymmetry between your ability to attack your opponent successfully and his ability to attack you successfully. The greater the asymmetry, the greater will be the chance of your success. There are many fine attacking positions in the sport of jiu jitsu, ashi garami, the mounted position, knee on stomach variations etc. However, none can match the power of the rear mount/back position when it comes to creating this asymmetry in your favor. The very nature of the human body is well adapted to dealing with threats from the front, but poorly set up to deal with threats from the rear. Much of your training then, most be devoted to getting to, maintaining and finishing from this position. Here, young Nicky Ryan works hard on his skills utilizing our back attack system, an area that he excels in.
