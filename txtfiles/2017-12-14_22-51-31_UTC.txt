Orientation, disorientation and control: A common feature of jiu jitsu sparring and matches is the degree to which athletes are put into very contorted positions whilst upside down, inverted, spinning around an axis etc. Usually these situations occur spontaneously and in a very short time frame. Often they are quite different from the usual moves we practice in the gym. In any extreme, uncontrolled scramble situation of this kind, it is vital that the athlete have a general sense of direction and a few key concepts in mind SO THAT THEY CAN CREATE ORDER OUT OF CHAOS AND STEER EVENTS IN THEIR FAVOR. So often I see students clamoring for endless details on a specific position. This is a good thing, but even better is the student who seeks to place the details in ORDER OF IMPORTANCE and focus primarily upon the most vital ones. In wild scrambles where your orientation is very different what you are used to and time is of essence, a few key concepts will be far more useful to you than a mountain of details. Here, Garry Tonon finds himself in a position, ashi garami, with which he is extremely familiar, but in an unusual manifestation - vertical with the foot uncontrolled. Focusing upon the main features of ashi garami control, he was able to rein in ADCC medalist Vagner Rocha and bring this unpromising situation back under control into a much more standard ashi garami so that just a few seconds after this photo was taken, his opponent was tapping in submission to a finely applied heel hook variation.
