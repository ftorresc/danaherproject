Work in pairs, triples and quadruples: Having a strong offensive move is a wonderful thing, but not nearly so wonderful as having a strong complimentary move that goes in the opposite direction to overcome resistance to the first move. Better still when you have a third or fourth move (I donâ€™t recommend going beyond four shot combinations as typically by that point control and connection has been lost to a degree that follow up attacks are unrealistic). Remember that the fundamental feature of sparring and competition is RESISTANCE TO WHATEVER YOU ATTEMPT, so having moves that feed off that resistance is one of the keys to success. Here, Gordon Ryan is threatening with one of his best weapons, a strong hook sweep (sumi gaeshi) off a shoulder crunch grip. His opponent is contorting himself to avoid the sweep, but in doing so is exposing himself to two submission follow ups - one upper body (straight armlock ude gatame) and the other lower body (ashi garami based leg locks). Mr Ryan chose lower body and easily entered the legs (unfortunately time ran out just as he got the position). Never think in terms of single attacks but rather, always go the extra distance and conceive of a complementary follow up that follows the lines of resistance to the first move - you will soon be rewarded with breakthroughs against even the toughest resistance.
