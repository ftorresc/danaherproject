Give - in order to take: A tactic that we often use in submission Grappling is that of "attack by concession" This involves conceding good position  and allowing our opponent an apparent advantage. Normally I would frown upon such tactics - certainly this is not wise for a beginner to attempt, nor against someone you believe is easily capable of exploiting that positional advantage at your cost, nor in a real fight where striking is involved. However, if you have justifiable faith in your ability to generate effective movement even in bad position against your opponent, then temporarily giving up position can be a fine means of creating opportunities to attack. Very often opponents will take risks with limb extension in dominant positions that they would never take in neutral positions, as a result, when an escape is made, those extended limbs can are often very vulnerable for a brief period. In addition, this tactic can often be useful against a very cautious or timid opponent who is simply not engaging in neutral positions. The key of course is to first be strong at pin escapes and second, to be able to seamlessly tie together your escape skills with your submission skills. Here, Garry Tonon makes use of a method of escaping mount that all my athletes excel in, the "kipping escape." It is very different from conventional escapes from mount, but provides a superb platform to enter immediately into a wide array of submissions the moment you are free. Just half a second after this photo was taken, Mr Tonon was attacking his opponent's legs. I remember as this occurred the crowd murmured in concern as the opponent mounted, sensing impending doom, and were shocked to see effective offense come out of such a situation.
