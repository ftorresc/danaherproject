Enjoying the view in Singapore: Three hours before airport - squad heads to Marina Bay Sands hotel - 47th floor and a stellar view of Singapore with City on one side, water and the mighty port with thousands of ships from around the world making their stop on the other. An incredible place and a fascinating look into the heart of modern Asia. From the Far East, back soon to the West - we shall miss this place.
