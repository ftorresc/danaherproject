Teaching here - Teaching there: Just wrapped up a weekend teaching to the fine folks of Sudbury, Canada along with my great friend and mentor, Ricardo Almeida. It was all organized by Renzo Gracie Ottawa stalwart, Pat Cooligan, who has done an incredible job of taking our Sensei's philosophy and techniques and introducing them across Ontario and beyond. Now I am racing through airports and back in NYC! A big week of training coming up starting first thing Monday morning as Eddie Cummings goes back on stage to take on three time world champion Samir Chantre next Saturday in Fight to Win Pro 31. Nicky Ryan goes west to California with teammates Matthew Tesla and Jason Rau, to attempt to become the youngest athlete ever (fifteen) to qualify for the world championships at the American ADCC trials. Then it's uptown to the Bronx academy to check out progress of the Bombers as they continue to impress me with their development. It's always a special feeling returning to NYC from travel - I have loved here 25 years and it's never lost it's charm, pace and excitement for me - but even that feeling pales compared with the excitement of returning to train the troops in the dojo as they work hard towards their dreams and aspirations.
