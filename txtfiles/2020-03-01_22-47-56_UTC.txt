Nothing good comes from standing directly in front of your opponents feet and knees - get to your angles! The legs are the center of Jiu Jitsu. When you’re in bottom position, everything is about keeping your legs between you and your opponent. When you’re in top position it’s all about getting past his legs. Whenever you are playing top game, LOOK TO GET OFFLINE AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE AND AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE and you will soon be much more successful. Your hands are not strong enough to move an opponents legs by themselves - so use your hands only to temporarily immobilize his legs just long enough to step to an angle. Once you get a good angle outside the legs, your opponent is now in a defensive cycle and is now primarily concerned with retaining his guard rather than attacking you - that means you can focus on passing his guard rather than defending sweeps and submissions - and that will help make you much more successful in top position!
