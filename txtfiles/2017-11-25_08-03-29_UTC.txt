Polishing the edge: When sharpening a dull knife, the initial work is heavy grinding of the edge on very abrasive surfaces that remove metal in ways that gradually change and thin the edge geometry to Bring back the sharpness. As the sharpening process continues, progressively finer abrasives are used that remove less and less metal. At the end of the process the edge of the blade is polished by the finest abrasives. At that point there is no more metal removal, just light polishing that leaves a mirror smooth edge that gleams and cuts like a razor. So too in jiu jitsu contest preparation. During the normal training cycle, the work is heavy and designed to change the athletes skill set. As the contest approaches, the training changes to light work designed to polish already existing skills.
