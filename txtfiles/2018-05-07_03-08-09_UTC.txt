Great day of teaching in LA at two of my favorite West Coast schools @5starmartialarts and @dynamixmma showing triangle and leg lock lock systems insights and techniques. We had to cap the dynamixmma seminar at one hundred people - it was wonderful seeing the big class going through some advanced leg lock work and perform it well - our Californian fans are getting the hang of this game!! ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤— We always love coming out to LA and meeting our friends and followers - always mixed feelings when I return of missing LA and yet happy to see my dedicated students back home in NYC. I shall go and catch the red eye home to be ready to teach the big Monday class at RGA - always a thrill to see the room packed with bodies and dreams - and the will to make them a reality. Thanks again to our gracious hosts and students in LA!!
