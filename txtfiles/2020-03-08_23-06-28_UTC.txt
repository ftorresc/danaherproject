Fighting the big guys - the story of Nick Ronan: This weekend in England, talented junior Nick Ronan entered the Polaris Grappling Grand Prix qualifier tournament in Bristol UK and won gold. What makes this a really interesting story is that Mr Ronan weighs less than 170 pounds and this was an open weight tournament with many of his opponents weighing over 240 pounds and higher belts. Now my advice to my students when they take on the big boys is always the same - FOCUS YOUR ATTACKS UPON THE BACK AND THE LEGS - for these are the areas of the body in which strength and size play the least role in the outcome. The human body is set up in such a way that no one can apply much strength behind themselves and with regards the legs, dexterity, positioning and knowledge play a much bigger role in the outcome than size. Nick Ronan did exactly that - winning every match by heel hook or back attack. When you take on the big men - focus your attacks on the back and the legs and get the breakthroughs! Now Nick Ronan is qualified to enter the Grand Prix tournament and compete against some of the most famous heavyweights in the world!
