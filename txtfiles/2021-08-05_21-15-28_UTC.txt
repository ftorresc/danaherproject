Sometimes when you look at it Jiu jitsu just seems like a hopeless and disorganized tangle of thrashing limbs - but always remember that under that apparent chaos there are TWO THINGS that give Jiu jitsu direction - POSITIONAL DOMINANCE and SUBMISSION. Understand that no matter confusing or complicated it may seem there are only five dominant positions and around fifteen high percentage submissions in the game - as long as youâ€™re constantly searching and working towards those two end points you will be going forward. Keep your mind on the endgame and your Jiu jitsu will always have direction minute by minute however disorganized and disoriented it might appear second by second.
