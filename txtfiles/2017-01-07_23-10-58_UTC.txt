Reflections on my sensei: There was a blizzard of snow today in NYC. When I Made my way down to the academy I was wondering how many people would show up for training. When I arrived, Sensei was on the mat teaching a packed class ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š He had driven in all the way from Holmdel NJ in the blizzard to make sure whoever came in got a memorable workout - and that they got! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š Mr Gracie taught a fascinating kimura variation often utilized by his student, Matt Serra, along with some modifications he had made. It was a beautiful demonstration of teaching skill. Anyone can teach their own game - BUT IT TAKES REAL INSIGHT AND KNOWLEDGE TO TEACH ANOTHER MANS GAME AND ILLUMINATE ITS SUBTLETIES AND NUANCES. Mr Gracie has a warmth and charisma that makes a class more than technical lesson, but also a joy to the soul. Afterwards he and judo superstar Travis Stevens stayed to help the squad through a days training for upcoming tournaments. I came down to the academy wondering if anyone would be there - it ended being one of the most enjoyable  training days I can remember. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š As I make my home through the blizzard I cannot help but think of how fortunate I am to have had this man as my teacher more than twenty years ago and how the same knowledge and personality can lift and inspire a new generation of students today.
