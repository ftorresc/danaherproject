Four vs two: One of the primary motivations to use open guard positions is that you can fight with four of your limbs while your opponent can only use two against you. He gets two (weaker) limbs along with the mobility advantage of being on his feet and the weight/pressure of gravity as his weapons. You as the guard player get four limbs (including the two strongest). This is the essential nature of the battle. You have different weapons but both are excellent - you have to learn how to use those different weapons to advantage. Learning to see the difference and use it to your advantage is a key part of winning the eternal battle between guard vs guard passer.
