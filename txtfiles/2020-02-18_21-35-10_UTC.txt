It is up to us to master all the major routes to the back if we are maximize our potential in the sport. While there are several good paths to the back, the simplest and most direct will always be that of getting past your opponents hands and elbows. There are vast number of ways to do this, and opportunity is everywhere, given that most of the time the two opponents are facing each other and trying to come to grips. It doesnâ€™t matter whether you are standing or on the ground, top or bottom, gi or no gi - EVERYTHING GETS EASIER WHEN YOU GET BEHIND AN OPPONENT. Understand that the METHOD of getting there are PHYSICAL, but the RECOGNITION OF OPPORTUNITY is MENTAL. Until you make the mental step of seeing the opportunity, the physical act of getting there will not happen - so train your mind to see the opportunity to take the back every time it occurs - your game will never be the same.
