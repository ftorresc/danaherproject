Gordon Ryan teaching a masterclass on attacks from closed guard: Gordon Ryan wows the big crowd at @evolvemma gym here in Singapore with his closed guard game. Mr Ryan will be putting out a whole video on our closed guard system later this year for @bjj.fanatics Itâ€™s amazing to see the crowd react to his teaching here and then take those concepts to the mat and live sparring and get the moves to work very quickly. Later on tonight itâ€™s training time with @garrytonon in his preparation for his fight in @onechampionship - all action here in Singapore ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ
