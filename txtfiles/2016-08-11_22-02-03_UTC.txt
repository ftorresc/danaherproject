Golden Girl: Another incredible day for American Judo as Kayla Harrison wins her second Olympic gold medal! She is the team mate of Travis Stevens, winner of the Olympic  silver medal yesterday. Like Mr Stevens, her primary coach is the great Olympian Jimmy Pedro, who has done an incredible job preparing the American squad for the Rio Olympics. I remember Mr Stevens telling me on many occasions how talented  Ms Harrison is and how she was not only the best in the world on the mats, but also a truly good and admirable person off the mats - she has an incredible story behind her road to Olympic glory that is an inspiration to all who research it. She showed again how strong the American squad is in Ne Waza (ground grappling) and how the American team is using this skill set to advantage against the world's best. What an incredible year for American Judo, for Ms Harrison, Mr Stevens and Mr Pedro. America and the world grappling community is so lucky to witness their work and success ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜ŠğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜Š
