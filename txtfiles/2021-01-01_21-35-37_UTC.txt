Why stay in front of opponents when you can get behind them: To a large degree Jiu jitsu is the skill of maneuvering behind opponents. Sure, you can finish people from frontal positions, but nothing will match the relative ease and certainty of getting behind people and working from there. Try to make this PROGRESSION TO THE BACK an IMMEDIATE REFLEX in your part. Opportunities don’t last long in competitive matches so the earlier you make your move the better in most cases. Just as you wouldn’t accept being in front of an opponents legs when playing against an opponents guard, but rather always seeking to get around his legs to the side, so to from turtle position always seek to get past your opponents arms and get to the back. Of course there will be times when you may favor frontal attacks such as Guillotines or other strangles from the front, but your default option should always be to go behind your opponent
