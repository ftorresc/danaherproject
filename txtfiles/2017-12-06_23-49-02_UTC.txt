Kasai Grappling Championship: This weekend the squad will go out for the last time this year at the First Kasai professional grappling championship. Garry Tonon will enter the 170 pound tournament against some of the most talented Welterweights in the world, most of whom are world champions or ADCC veterans. Gordon Ryan will take on two time ADCC gold medalist and multi time BJJ world champion, Yuri Simoes. This a tremendous line up of talent for an inaugural event. The organizers have done an incredible job of getting the best athletes in a first class venue in a show with great production quality. Rich Byrnes and Rolles Gracie have assembled a tremendous team of experts and I am really looking forward to what may become  one of the premier grappling organizations. The rule set is a great compromise between positional skills and submission skills that will reward purposeful action and punish passivity - a first period of submission only and then if no submission, a period with conventional points scoring to decide a winner. It’s wonderful to have in here in NYC - we normally have to travel to get to premier shows. The squad is working their way through the week getting prepared. Check out @kasaigrappling - it’s up to us as jiu jitsu fans and athletes to create the support that can give the athletes a forum to showcase the sport! Hope you all enjoy the show!
