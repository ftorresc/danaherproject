Keeping it fun: often people seem to assume that a gym putting out champions is probably a stern and strict environment where people follow very formal behavioral rules. In fact I prefer an environment where the training is heavy, but the atmosphere is light. I find the room has better training longevity when people ENJOY the atmosphere rather than ENDURE it. As such, visitors are often surprised when they hear us calling out off color jokes and insults to each other as training begins. When training is over, it's story and stand up routine time. Humor is the means by which students bond and get through tough tests and the inevitable disappointments of a highly competitive and difficult game where many play, but only one can win. Here, Georges St-Pierre takes some serious abuse from myself and Garry Tonon, I'm going to guess it has something to do with his choice of workout apparel ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜œðŸ˜–In which case it is well deserved ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚Finding that balance between work and play is important for the health of any training program.
