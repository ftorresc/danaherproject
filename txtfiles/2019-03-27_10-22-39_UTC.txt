Shoot Boxing: Garry Tonon goes through his shoot boxing drills and skills in preparation for his upcoming fight at @onechampionship  Tokyo. It is always fascinating to study how the presence of some new variable drastically changes the behavior of an established system. Nowhere is this more evident than in the case of shoot boxing - where the presence of takedowns drastically changes the established rhythms and patterns of boxing and kickboxing. Mr Tonon continues to make progress in this fascinating aspect of MMA training - he only started just over a year ago and has made tremendous progress in such a short time. Now itâ€™s back to the hotel and some reading, them some note taking for the next video series I will make on BJJ Fundamentals. So impressed by hospitality and friendliness of local people - I hope @onechampionship has many more events here!
