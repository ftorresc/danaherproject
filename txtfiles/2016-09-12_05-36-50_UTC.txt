The return of the King: Expectations were high when Gordon Ryan returned to EBI 8 tonight. Mr Ryan did not disappoint - he submitted all four of his opponents, one in overtime to take the gold. It was a fascinating tournament for him as several people who had defeated him when he was younger were present. However, there was no stopping him tonight as he showed many excellent entries and finishes to submission holds. It was a superb demonstration of our vision of jiu jitsu - control that leads to submission. Mr Eddie Bravo continues to put on a strong and exciting show that promotes a new vision of the sport.
