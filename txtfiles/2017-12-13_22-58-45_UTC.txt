Integrated systems: Most of you know that a distinctive feature of my approach to jiu jitsu is to focus upon specific, easily attainable scenarios and build complex systems around them that enable an athlete to control that position and work towards submission. Because the system is very comprehensive it offers the athlete a tremendous KNOWLEDGE ADVANTAGE over his or her opponent in that specific domain which the opponent will find very problematic to deal with and overcome. Very often you will see my students making use of some of our more well known systems - back, front headlock, Kimura, juji gatame/sankaku, And ashi garami among many others. In truth however, ANY ONE SYSTEM CAN COME UP SHORT UNDER THE PRESSURE OF TOP LEVEL COMPETITION. It is of the first importance then, that athletes work towards the most important goal of my approach to jiu jitsu - THE INTEGRATION OF THE VARIOUS SYSTEMS SO THAT THE ATHLETE CAN APPLY PRESSURE WITH ONE, WITH THE ABILITY TO PASS SEAMLESSLY TO ANOTHER AND RENEW THE ATTACK UNTIL THE SUSTAINED PRESSURE BREAKS THROUGH RESISTANCE AND SUBMISSION IS ATTAINED. This INTEGRATED SYSTEMS APPROACH  is what all my athletes strive towards. Here, outstanding apprentice (kohai), Nick Ronan shows superb integration of ashi garami and back systems to create extreme pressure on opponent, Mike Davila to get the breakthrough and submission in fine style at @kasaigrappling championships this weekend.
