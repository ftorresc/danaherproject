HAPPY NEW YEAR FROM THE SQUAD!! Wishing you all the best for 2021!! Thank you all for your interest in the incredible work of my students and our philosophy of Jiu jitsu. We hope to show much more of our work around the Jiu jitsu world in the coming year - hopefully fate proves kinder to Jiu Jitsu this year than last, but whatever happens, dedication and determination will always prevail over hard times - wishing you all a great night and an even better year!
