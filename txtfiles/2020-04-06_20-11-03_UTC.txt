The power of observation: There are many great learning tools in Jiu Jitsu - I always rate realistic drilling, experimental research and structured sparring as the three most important. Another which I value highly is OBSERVATION. You can learn a tremendous amount through ACTIVE observation of athletes sparring. By this I mean watch the action in such a way that you are actively trying to assess what the athletes ought to be doing second by second - essentially the act of putting your mind inside their sparring session and critiquing them second by second. This can be done either watching live as we are here, or video. Whenever the main methods of sparring, drilling and physical experimentation arenâ€™t available - go ahead with active observation - you will love the results next time you are on the mats.
