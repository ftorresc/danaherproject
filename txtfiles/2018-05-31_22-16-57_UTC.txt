Nicky Ryan seminar in Los Angeles this Sunday: Nicky Ryan will show our fans in LA the intricacies of our approach to the game this Sunday at one of our favorite LA gyms @dynamixmma on 6/3 at 3:30pm. Not only will he show the essential squad approach to the game, but his personal approach to it. All my students are innovators and researchers. All have their own specialty moves that they developed independently and which figure prominently in their game. This independence is the most exciting thing for a coach to witness and to see it in such a young man is truly remarkable. If you are within distance of Santa Monica on Sunday - Check our this amazing young athlete and teacher and see for yourself the knowledge and skill that I am lucky enough to witness daily. As always - a big hello to our West Coast followers ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
