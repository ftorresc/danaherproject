Memories: Here is a set of photos taken in the basement from long ago. This was during the MMA period of my coaching prior to the squad. My primary focus was on getting Georges St Pierre and Chris Weidman to championship victories. The grappling classes reflected the needs of the athletes for a Jiu jitsu that would apply well to the cage. You can see Mr St Pierre, my great friends Roger Gracie (who was transitioning from grappling to MMA at this time) and Romulo Barral, Shawn Williams and a VERY young Garry Tonon (did you recognize him?). So many athletes have come through these doors over the years - different people, different goals, different times - but Jiu jitsu can be adapted to them all. Looking at these old photos makes me realize how lucky I have been to meet and work with so many amazing people over such a long time. I miss those old days and all the great people you see on the mats - wherever you all are I wish you the best! Stay safe. Hopefully before too long weâ€™ll all be back in action. Thanks to Luca Atalla for the awesome photos!
