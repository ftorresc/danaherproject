There arenâ€™t many certainties in life - but there is one certainty Iâ€™ve learned in Jiu Jitsu that I would bet my life on and which can help you become very effective from open guard - IF YOU CAN GET A GRIP ON BOTH OF YOUR OPPONENTS LEGS AND EXERT A PUSHING FORCE BACKWARDS THAT GETS HIS CENTER OF GRAVITY BEHIND HIS HEELS - Then I donâ€™t give a damn how fast, strong, heavy, flexible, acrobatic or athletically talented your opponent is - HE WILL FALL TO HIS BUTT - GUARANTEED. That does not guarantee you will score - a tough opponent may well scramble back up and recover before you can score - but I promise you he will fall - and that gives you an EXCELLENT scoring opportunity that in time you can exploit every time youâ€™re on the mats. Here I am using ashi garami to control one leg whilst holding the other - both ankles controlled and a simple push with the ashi garami - KNOCK DOWN! Every time - now itâ€™s up to you to work for the score/top position from there. Make this simple insight part of your open guard game and I promise you that you will start sweeping people you never previously swept ðŸ˜œ
