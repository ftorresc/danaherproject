Order of importance: Very often students come to me with a desire to learn the many precise details of a given move. This is a healthy and good attitude, as precision is very important for the successful application of moves in jiu jitsu. However, it is critical that BOTH THE INSTRUCTOR AND THE STUDENT BE ABLE TO RANK THE DETAILS IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE, SO THAT MORE ATTENTION IS PLACED UPON THE CRUCIAL DETAILS RATHER THAN THE AUXILIARY DETAILS. In truth, when you go to apply the moves in a match situation you will be under severe stress, and in any stressful situation, our cognitive abilities are greatly diminished. In a scenario where you can only recall a few details, ranking those details from most important to least important is the single best way to increase your effectiveness. Focus upon one crucial detail will do more for your performance of a given move in a tough match than ten trifling details. So when learning details, focus as much on the RANKING of the details as you do upon the ACCUMULATION of them. Making this a habit will enable you to make the most important adjustments quickly and under pressure - a skill you will need in a tight contest. Here I point out the most crucial elements of an ashi garami variation at a recent seminar so that beginners can make quicker progress towards development in this aspect of the game.
