Training in Puerto Rico with Georges St Pierre: OG squad founding member Georges St Pierre stopped by for training. Itâ€™s amazing to see how well he does just in pure grappling against specialists. The squad is getting ready for big upcoming matches in Texas at the end of the month for Whose Number One @flograppling Having Mr St Pierre always adds some electricity to the training room - and of course, his great standing grappling skills and takedowns! Looking forward to more hard work in preparation  for Texas! ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ
