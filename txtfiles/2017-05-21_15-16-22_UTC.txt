Singapore bound: At JFK with Garry Tonon and Nicky Ryan - heading to Singapore for the match with the great champion Shinya Aoki- NYC training complete - final preparation in Singapore with our friends at Evolve Gym. Long journey ahead, but as always, the biggest challenges and greatest steps require us travel far, either in distance, time or effort, and usually all three. Looking forward to another great challenge for the squad and our approach to the sport and exciting projects ahead when we return to NYC! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
