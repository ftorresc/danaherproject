Story time: The Renzo Gracie Academy has been a center of jiu jitsu training for almost twenty five years in NYC. In that time so much has happened, so much has changed and so much more to be done. Luca Atalla of Gracie Magazine took time to interview me with regards the early days of the academy, Mr Gracieâ€™s approach to teaching and why he produced such a list of champions. I also talk about teaching the MMA athletes who came to the academy to work on ground skills, the early days of the squad and other subjects. In time these should be released @gallerrapp and renzogracie.com. Lots of cherished memories and a great cast of characters!
