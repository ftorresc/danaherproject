Aim high: The single biggest obstacle to the learning and improving process is LOW EXPECTATIONS AND STANDARDS AMONG THOSE SEEKING IMPROVEMENT. A huge part of realizing your potential in Jiu Jitsu and indeed anything else in life, is your ability to form a culture of high standards and great expectations around yourself. Days where you exhibit a “that’s good enough” mentality are days wasted. Always ask the better question - “is my performance of this technique good enough to win a world championship.” Just that switch in mindset from “is this good enough to get by?” to “is this good enough to work on a world champion?” Will immediately drive you to better performance of that move. THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS HIGHER PERFORMANCE AGAINST OTHERS IS HIGHER STANDARDS AND EXPECTATIONS WITHIN YOURSELF. Make a habit of comparing yourself to ever greater standards and you will soon see improvement in your technique
