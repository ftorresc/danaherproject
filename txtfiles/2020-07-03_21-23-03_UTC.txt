Getting to truly know a move: Jiu jitsu does not reward superficial knowledge. If you know a little about a given move itâ€™s unlikely you will be able to perform it successfully against a fully resistant opponent your own size and skill level. Jiu jitsu rewards DEEP KNOWLEDGE. In order to get it to work you must know a LOT about how it works and how to apply it against someone who also knows how it works and how to stop it. As such, the general pattern of success in Jiu jitsu is to spend vast amounts of time and energy on a small set of moves to gain mastery of them to a point where you can get them to work against the toughest resistance. I teach a relatively small set of moves; for example, ninety percent of my submissions training time with my athletes is spent on only six submission systems, but my students have an unusually deep understanding of them. Jiu jitsu demands of you mastery - plan your training accordingly. Think of your favorite moves (Tokui waza) as trusted old friends who you know better than you know yourself. Spend time with them, studying them and understanding them - and when you call upon them for help in a tough battle, they will be far more valuable to you than a thousand superficial friends and passing acquaintances
