Controlled aggression: Ultimately the goal of all combat is victory. This requires at some point the notion of defeating an opponent through physical harm or the threat of physical harm. At some point we have to take the fight to the opponent in a way that gives us victory, thus there must be some degree of aggression involved, sometimes more, sometimes less, depending upon our character and the context of the situation we find ourselves in. The problem we  confront as beginners is that nature teaches very naive forms of aggression. Watch any street fight between untrained and inexperienced protagonists and you will see a comedic array of missteps, lost opportunities and unforced errors as the fearless combatants try to express their aggression with what little knowledge they have. The various martial arts require us to direct our aggression through thick layers of technique and strategy. This requires of us all a large measure of self control - in the mental and physical turmoil of combat, we have to insist upon precise mechanical details and refined movement; all set in the context of an overall plan that directs our technique. Building this mindset of a disciplined, methodical, detail oriented inner state whilst engaged in extreme physical turmoil is one of the most import aspects of our training. This is why live sparring must always be the foundation of an effective training program and why those who engage in live sparring have a huge advantage over those that do not. Here, young Nicky Ryan shows the kind of inner mental composure that allows him to focus on all the required mechanical details required for successful application of a heel hook variation he favors - all set during a tough match against a talented, knowledgeable opponent. There is no emotion here - just cold calculation - there will be time for emotion later
