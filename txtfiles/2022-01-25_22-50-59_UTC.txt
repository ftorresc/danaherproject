The positional core of Jiu jitsu is the task of getting to the mount or rear mount position: Jiu jitsu is a complex game with a great many moves. Underneath that complexity however, is a very simple desiderata - GET TO THE MOUNT OR REAR MOUNT POSITION. The mount and rear mount are the two highest scoring moves in Jiu jitsu for a reason - no other positions offer such an imbalance of attacking potential of the athlete holding these positions versus the athlete defending them. As such they represent the philosophical core of the sport - to attain a position where you can reliably attack an opponent with far greater effect than he can attack you. All of the takedowns, sweeps, passes and lesser pins are just a means to the ends of mount and rear mount. You don’t need mount or rear mount to submit people, but they are damn good positions to do so, so they fit in well with a submission specialist’s game as well as they do a positional player; and of course, when you simply can’t get an opponent to tap - you’ll need a positional game to win the day. Make sure your positional game has a goal - and remember always that the entire rules, point structure and philosophy of Jiu jitsu is to make the mount and the back the goal - make your training and your mentality line up with this and your game will always be in the spirit of Jiu jitsu
