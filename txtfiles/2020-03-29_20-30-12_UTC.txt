You can make the strongest arm weak if you put it behind an opponents back: A huge part of Jiu Jitsu is the study of exploiting the inherent weaknesses of the human body. For example a sizable part of my approach to leg locking is built around the simple idea that shackling an opponents two ankles together strips him of most of the mobility required to escape the ashi garami he is caught in. Another classic example is the idea of shackling a prisoners hands behind his back - a simple insight that has successfully restrained countless strong men since the dawn of time. Try to take advantage of the fact that there is a dramatic difference between our strength potential when our arms are in front of us versus situations where are arms are pinned behind us. The most commonly seen application of this principle in Jiu Jitsu is with the kimura lock. Kimura is often disparaged as a strong mans move - but if you can reliably get the opponents hand behind his back you can apply it very well on the strongest of opponents. Here, Craig Jones does a fine job of quickly getting an opponents hand behind his back to set up many potential attack options and completely robbing his opponents arm of any strength.
