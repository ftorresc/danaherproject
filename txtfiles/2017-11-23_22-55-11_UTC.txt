Next stop California: The squad heads to LA - big Gordon Ryan discovers he is no longer capable of fitting in regulation seat of Airbus 300 and must go in cargo. Preparation in NYC has been good. Now training in LA with old friend Shawn Williams. We shall stay in LA for next week to prepare for EBI 14 Open weight. Three tough matches/Tournaments in three different parts of the country in three weeks ðŸ˜³ Gordon Ryan knows how to prepare for holiday season! ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ Canâ€™t wait to see Eddie Cummings and Nicky when they arrive for their matches in LA along with Garry Tonon riding shotgun - itâ€™s all West coast for the squad this week! I wanted to wish you all a happy Thanksgiving from the squad. Hope you all got a chance to recharge batteries and get ready for training again! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ˜Š
