Even the best move applied at the best time can fail due to just a single mistake if the opponent is strong on defense. Aim for perfection in every aspect of execution - you can’t close every door - but the more you do - the more success you will have. Don’t be satisfied with good, aim for great in your areas of specialty in the game!
