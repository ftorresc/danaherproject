Hanging out with the old gang: At a friends book signing party in downtown Manhattan tonight and ran into two of my favorite people in grappling - Eddie Cummings and Ottavia Busia - Mr Cummings took a short break from training in preparation for Kasai Grappling this weekend where he and Nicky Ryan have exciting super fight action against very tough opponents. He is in great shape and working hard on new elements of his ever developing game and brand. Also looking significantly more stylish these days too! ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ make sure you tune in for @kasaigrappling this weekend in NYC! Should be a great weekend of action!
