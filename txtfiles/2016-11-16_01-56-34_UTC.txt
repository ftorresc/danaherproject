Formality and informality: As a general rule I prefer a rather informal class setting. I believe formality can be a good thing in children's and beginner class, but I don't emphasize it at all in advanced classes. I don't really like being called professor, I work with first names and students do the same to me. We laugh a lot and say horribly inappropriate but (usually) funny things to each other all day ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‚. I have always found the deepest and most profound forms of respect are unspoken in daily life and only get uttered on special occasions. The ceremonial aspects of respect, belts, saying "osu" to everything you hear, calling everyone above you in rank professor- we only do on a few special occasions. I always liked the informal atmosphere that my master, Renzo Gracie fostered. There was no endless talk about respect - but there was a stronger unspoken sense of respect for him and the project we engaged in than any ceremonially lavish atmosphere I saw. Real respect manifests itself in significant actions, not words or trivialities. When I see athletes who study under me getting up every day at 5am to get to morning class and then work out between then and the afternoon class and then go home to an evening workout, study and practice the moves and concepts we expound, push through pain, fatigue and injury to finish a workout, make an extra effort to help a team mate prepare for competition - how can I not respect them? And what words can capture the respect I feel I my heart for these men and women who do this, not for weeks and months, but for years, until they break though to their goals. Better to leave it unsaid. I focus on performance improvement and let respect come about naturally. Here the squad relaxes after another tough workout getting Eddie Cummings ready for EBI 10. Judging by the looks on our faces there is a 99% chance we are talking about women or some other fun subject - anything except jiu jitsu performance ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
