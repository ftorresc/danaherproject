First contact: Every grappling match begins with the closing of distance and first physical contact, whether it be in standing position or on the floor - it greatly behooves you to have a plan in mind BEFORE first contact rather than make contact and see what happens. There are only so many ways the two of you can initiate contact - having a good response to the major possibilities worked out ahead of time let’s you get off to a good start - and when you are facing tough opponents, that’s a great thing. In order to make an effective and proactive first contact you will need an appropriate STANCE, MOTION, GRIP FIGHTING SEQUENCE and PLAN OF ACTION for the initial encounter. These will all vary depending upon what your aims are. Make sure you devote some time developing these SKILLS OF FIRST CONTACT. So many times the outcome is heavily influenced by those crucial opening seconds.
