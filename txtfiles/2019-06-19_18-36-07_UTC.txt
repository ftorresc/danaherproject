BJJ Fanatics @BJJ.fanatics just released a fun video  free on YouTube that Bernardo Faria, Gordon Ryan and I made giving a general overview of Jiu Jitsu as a systematic approach to unarmed combat. Itâ€™s always fun working with these guys and talking about the sport and martial art we all love. Check it out - see if you like it. Perhaps it will give you a slightly clearer view of what we aim towards in a way that will make it easier to see for yourself or to explain to friends and family who have no knowledge of the sport.
