The link between standing technique and ground technique: A theme that I always push upon my students is that of balancing standing technique (tachi waza) and ground technique (ne waza). The most high percentage submission holds are all best performed on the ground, where control over an opponent's movement is usually much easier than standing positions. Nonetheless, considerable time must be invested in bringing the fight down to the mat in ways that make submission possible if the art is to have serious combative value (and of course, the opposite - getting back up to your feet from the ground if the situation should demand it). This ability to move naturally and easily from standing positions to ground and back and forth at will is a fine thing to behold and has immense combat value. Of course in submission grappling most of our attention is devoted to the means of getting to, and finishing, submission holds - so we cant realistically expect the kind of level of technique in specialized standing grappling styles like Olympic wrestling and Judo. What I often say to my students is this: I EXPECT YOU TO BE KILLERS ON THE GROUND AND COMPETENT ON THE FEET. This a fair view that reflects the priorities of the sport whilst paying respect to the realities of combat. What we must avoid is situations where students get to a high level on the floor but are straightforwardly incompetent on their feet. Here kohai student Matthew Tesla shows a nice link between standing work and ground work utilizing de ashi harai, a form of footsweep that our team greatly favors for its efficiency (you may remember it being used to good effect by Gordon Ryan against Keenan Cornelius) in a recent local tournament. It is a very nicely performed sequence and reflects very well on Mr Tesla's rapidly growing skill set.
