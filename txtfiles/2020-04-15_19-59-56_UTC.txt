There are a thousand possible targets for you to attack from bottom positions - but whenever possible - make your opponents BALANCE the first target - only then will all the others be realistic options. Gordon Ryan does a fine job here of getting his opponent completely out of balance - now he can attack wherever he chooses - upper body, lower body or sweep/reversal. Your opponents first line of defense to all your attacks is his stance - if you take him out of balance you will break his defense and open a floodgate for all your favorite moves.
