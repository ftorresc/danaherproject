Ideal positioning and less than ideal: When we first begin to learn a move it is wise to begin study under ideal conditions - your body well aligned in the preferred position for that particular move. In competition and sparring however, IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES YOU WILL HAVE TO PERFORM YOUR MOVES IN LESS THAN IDEAL POSITIONS AND ORIENTATIONS THAT NATURALLY OCCUR WITH MAXIMUM RESISTANCE. As such, we often practice finishes in a range of different orientations - belly up, belly down, inverted, rolling through etc etc. In this way there are no surprises on match day - you will be prepared for any contingency as you go in to finish your move. Here, Frank Rosenthal easily adapts to a belly down rolling situation when he needed to - finishing a fine inside heel hook at Kasai Grappling Championship in fine style - strong preparation in non ideal scenarios made for  a flawless finish against strong resistance.
