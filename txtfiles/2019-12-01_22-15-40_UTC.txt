Big win for juggernaut Nicky Rod! Nick Rodriguez had a barn burning grappling match over the weekend with UFC legend Luke Rockhold. Mr Rockhold is one of the best grapplers in MMA. He is a superb athlete with great flexibility and strength along with excellent technique - I know numerous grappling specialists who were shocked at his abilities when they grappled him in the gym. Nicky Rod used his inimitable fusion of explosive wrestling and back attacks to get a well deserved win and show his continued development. He continues to impress everyone with the speed of his progress - his propensity to get to the back out of scrambles created by his wrestling skills makes him a very dangerous opponent even for the best out there. This coming week sees another fusion of wrestling and Jiu Jitsu skills as Gordon Ryan takes on the great American wrestler Bo Nickal in a hybrid Wrestling/Jiu Jitsu rules match in Houston Texas this weekend. Itâ€™s great to see the merging of the skills of these two great combat sports and the growth and development it can create!
