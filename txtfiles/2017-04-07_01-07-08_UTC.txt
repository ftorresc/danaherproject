Exciting days ahead: Great week of training with the squad. Gordon Ryan has been peaking well for his superfight against world no gi champion Lucas "Hulk"Barbosa this Saturday night in New Jersey at Fight to Win pro 30. Once again Mr Ryan, a welterweight, will test himself against the big men at light heavy weight. Then April 15 in Philadelphia, the return of Eddie Cummings on his bout against three time world champion Shamir Chantre at Fight to Win Pro 31. I really believe Mr Cummings game has attained a new level of development and I am very excited to see him competing again. Across country in California, fifteen year old Nicky Ryan will battle at the American ADCC trials  in an attempt to become the youngest person ever to qualify for the world championships. With him will be outstanding kohai student, Matthew Tesla as he attempts to qualify for ADCC at 170 pounds. Behind it all is Garry Tonon, working hard in preparation for his grappling superfight against Shinya Aoki in what will be one of the highest paid, most watched and most anticipated grappling matches in history going down in Singapore on May 26. All great events, all great goals for the squad but as always we are all mindful of the fact that these lofty goals are only attainable by the most mundane means - hard, intelligently directed training in the dojo. The greatest goals are aspired to from the humblest and most everyday beginnings
