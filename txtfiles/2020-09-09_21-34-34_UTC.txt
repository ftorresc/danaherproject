Purpose: The single most important thing you carry into your daily workout is not your skill, your knowledge or your desire or most of the things mentioned in this regard - ITS A SENSE OF PURPOSE. Know what you want to work on and achieve in every session and you will soon find that progress becomes the norm rather than the exception. Time spent just rolling around sparring is fun and itâ€™s fine to do that periodically or on light days, but it does very little to MAKE YOU BETTER THAN YOU WERE BEFORE THE WORKOUT. Going in to a workout KNOWING WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE AND HAVING A SIMPLE PLAN TO DO SO makes all the difference. When the workout is over, you will have a sense of improvement and a sense of what you you need to do tomorrow. If you can stack up many such workouts over time - you can achieve things that once seemed impossible
