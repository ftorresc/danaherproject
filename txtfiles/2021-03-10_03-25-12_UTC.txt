Going beyond pinning: The basic theme of Jiu jitsu is of getting to dominant upper body pins to gain positional advantage. To actually SUBMIT someone however, you’ll need to do more than pin them - YOU WILL NEED TO ISOLATE A LIMB. Learning to isolate and control a limb from a dominant pin is the bridge between position and submission. Whenever you get to a pin in training don’t be satisfied with the points you’ve scored. Go further and isolate a limb - that is the only way you will be able to submit opponents.
