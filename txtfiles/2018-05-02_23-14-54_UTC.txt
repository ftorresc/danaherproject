Spoiled brats on the loose in LA: Gordon Ryan and myself head down to train at Shawn Williams @5starmartialarts in a good friendâ€™s McClaren 720 - the only thing scarier than this carâ€™s power output is Gordon Ryanâ€™s driving - here he is about to do another Mario Andretti impersonation ðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜¨ Great training at Mr Williamsâ€™ academy today - now itâ€™s back to LA home to plot and plan for Saturday and a lighter workout tonight. Wishing you all well from LA!!
