Pre-match attitude - study in contrasts: Different athletes enter matches with very different mindsets. The important thing is that they be comfortable and natural. I try to go with what feels right for them and what have been the dominant themes of our fight camp, rather than any preconceived notion of what is right or wrong for an athlete to feel before competition. Garry Tonon and Eddie Cummings went through camp together in preparation for ADCC world championships, but you can see the difference in pre-match mindset. Garry is as always, relaxed and jovial. Eddie looks like...um...a serial killer who kills by leg lock? Photo by Tiago Molinos
