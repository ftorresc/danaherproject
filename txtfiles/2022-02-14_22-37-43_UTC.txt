The power of wrestling! We had a visit today from some truly outstanding wrestlers - Jason Nolf and Geno Morelli from the Penn State program came in and deeply impressed everyone with their skill on the mats! We’ve been extremely impressed in the past by Penn State wrestlers Roman Bravo Young and Dan Vallimont - that program seems to create wrestlers who adapt extremely well to Jiu jitsu. Wrestlers who exhibit a smoother, movement and set up based style (J’den Cox is a good example) seem to make the adaptation to Jiu jitsu easier than other wrestlers. It was a great experience watching them in action - Mr Nolf successfully performed his patented Dixie roll in live sparring! It’s always a pleasure to see and learn from talented visitors and they don’t get more talented than these fellows. Interestingly the general pattern for the future is towards increasing integration of wrestling with jiu jitsu rather than the silly tribal rivalry between grappling arts that was prevalent when I began. We learned a bunch of stuff today that could easily be integrated into Jiu jitsu and make it a better sport for the future
