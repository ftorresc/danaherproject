Garry Tonon getting ready: Garry Tonon is counting down the days to his next MMA fight in Singapore for @onechampionship where he takes on the very talented Japanese title contender Koyomi Matsushima, who brings a very dangerous mix of Karate and Wrestling into the fight mixed with great experience in high level organizations at championship level. Mr Tonon has trained very thoroughly despite all the inherent problems due to covid restrictions and is ready for action. Sadly i will not be able to go with him this time due to covid restrictions in Singapore that only allow one person to accompany him so we agreed to send a sparring partner for preparation as he has to arrive very early for quarantine purposes and will need to train over there. Mr Tonon continues to expand his MMA repertoire but still we out a heavy emphasis on our style of Jiu jitsu as the core of his preparation. He goes onstage December 4th - hope you all enjoy the show!
