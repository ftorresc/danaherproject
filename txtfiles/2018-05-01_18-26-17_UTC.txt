Very happy to see my sensei, Renzo Gracie, announce that RGA will work with We Defy Foundation - a charitable organization that uses jiu jitsu training to help rehabilitate and improve the lives of injured US combat veterans throughout the nation. I have always believed that jiu jitsu can play a very positive role in our lives outside the dojo, but listening to the stories of returning disabled veterans took that to an entirely different level @wedefyfoundation made me look at the powers of jiu jitsu in a new light and with even greater optimism.
