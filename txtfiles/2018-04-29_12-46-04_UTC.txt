Neiman Gracie wins again! Outstanding MMA jiu jitsu representative, Neiman Gracie extended his unbeaten record in fine style last night with another very impressive submission victory at Bellator 198 - taking out a very tough opponent with a beautiful kata gatame strangle in the second round. It was a great match to watch as Mr Gracie showed the various influences of his father, Marcio Stambowsky, his sensei, Renzo Gracie and Mentor Royce Gracie along with kickboxing coach Jamie Crowder in a very impressive blend that has produced an incredible winning streak that has taken him very close to title contention now. Well done Neiman Gracie!!
