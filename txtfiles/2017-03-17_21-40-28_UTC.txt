Making a statement: It's one thing to win a tournament- it's quite another to predetermine HOW you will win the tournament. Two days before EBI 11, Gordon Ryan told me he would not use any joint lock submissions, but instead, limit himself to strangleholds with the arms (no sankaku/triangles using the legs) as the means of victory. Oftentimes people complain that our squad only wins via leg lock because we have an advantage in that department and that we are thus a team of "one trick ponies." In fact, anyone familiar with my teachings will know I actually have a preference for strangleholds over all forms of joint lock, including leg locks. A huge part of our training is spent in refining our back and front headlock systems to get into strangleholds, yet most commentators only speak of our leg locks. I was initially worried about this limitation- in general I prefer to use HANDICAPPING - the practice of limiting your submissions to a few chosen ones and not allowing yourself any others as a method of TRAINING rather than something to do in competition. Mr Ryan, however, had trained very diligently and his strangles were very sharp indeed so I felt confident he could get his plan to work. Handicapping is one of our most commonly used training methodologies, it was odd, but extremely impressive to watch it being used in high level competition. Here, Gary Tonon and I call out the sequences of our back attack system to Mr Ryan in the finals as he closes in on the stranglehold- but there is no need - he knows them so well it is like clockwork as opponents are progressively tied up and rendered defensively ineffective.
