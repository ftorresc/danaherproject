TRIANGLES (Sankaku)- the principle of MULTIPLICITY : So often I hear people in Jiu Jitsu talk about THE triangle stranglehold and it is very clear they are talking about the FRONT triangle (the most common version of the triangle in BJJ). There are FIVE main versions of the triangle 
FRONT (Omote sankaku)
REAR (Ushiro Sankaku)
OPPOSITE (Hantai sankaku)
SIDE (Yoko sankaku)
REVERSE (Gyaku sankaku)
ONLY WHEN YOU LEARN TO USE ALL OF THEM WILL YOU MAXIMIZE YOUR POTENTIAL WITH THIS INCREDIBLE MOVE. Learning to use the multiplicity of triangles will enable you to get submissions that would have previously eluded you as oftentimes when you have one form of triangle that is failing, a simple shift to another version will get the breakthrough you seek. Donâ€™t limit yourself to one dominant form of the triangle. The triangle system I teach is composed of all five major triangles and the interaction between them, along with the interaction with other submission holds and pins. Here, Georges St-Pierre works the transition from front triangle to opposite triangle (hantai sankaku) - a move greatly favored by the Ryan brothers - Gordon Ryan used it to strangle Ralek Gracie in competition. When you think about your triangle attacks, try to get out of the habit of thinking the triangle only refers to front triangles - while front triangles are the most important of the triangle family of strangles, that kind of thought process can blind you to other, very valuable alternatives. Why work with one great weapon when you can have five?
