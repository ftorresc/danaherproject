Nicky Ryan vs Uriah Faber: Very pleased to see Nicky Ryan will face off against MMA legend Uriah Faber at Polaris Pro 10 on May 25 in England. Mr Faber always showed great grappling skill throughout his MMA career and was renown for a devastating guillotine which he often used to win his matches. As a grappler he has gone the distance with one of the very best in the world - none other than Paulo Miyao - so he is no stranger to taking on the best in pure grappling. Mr Ryan was back in the gym training today in preparation for this next great challenge - this should be a tremendous match as both athletes are known for a dynamic attacking style! As always, Mr Ryan will go in with a serious strength disadvantage but he is used to that and structures his game around movement and positioning to overcome it. Looking forward to helping with preparation for this show against such a great opponent!
