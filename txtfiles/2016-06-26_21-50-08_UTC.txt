Teaching to teach: Throughout my coaching career I have always avoided the common tendency to teach with a "do this, do that" approach to jiu jitsu. I always try to teach not only the "how" of a given move, but also the "why." In this way students learn not only the technical performance  of the move, but also the contextual elements that show them not only how to use it, but when and why. As I teach my students, I always try to do so in a way that enables them to teach others the same lesson. I do this by trying to explain the logic and rationale behind each move. I don't want students who can merely mimic a move, I want students who can understand its underlying principles. Teaching in this manner has a pleasing side effect; not only do students make faster progress in their own games, they rapidly take on the ability to teach these skills to others. Rather than be able to merely regurgitate information, they can explain information - a critical difference. In this way the overall level of the training room can increase quite rapidly and a mutually beneficial training environment can emerge and take root. Here my student, Garry Tonon shows his pedagogical skills with young Mikey Wilson, an outstanding ten year old student. Garry is explaining the mechanical underpinnings of ude gatame, one of our favorite upper body attacks as young Mikey enacts them.
