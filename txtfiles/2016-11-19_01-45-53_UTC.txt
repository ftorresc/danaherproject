Attacking the whole body: A common misunderstanding of my approach to jiu jitsu is that I emphasize leg attacks over others. This is probably due to the fact that I teach a very advanced system of leg attacks to my students who compete in an atmosphere where most of their opponents have a relatively primitive understanding of leg attacks - so a disproportionate number of their victories come via that method. In fact, I always preach to my students the theme of attacking the whole body in order to succeed with favorite moves (tokui waza). When it comes to submissions, we have three choices. Strangles, upper body joint locks and lower body joint locks (there are a few others, but they are of much less importance). Any attempt to over emphasize any one of those three options will always create strong defensive reactions which ironically, will make it harder to break through at that intended target. A much better idea is to spread your attacks over the whole body with equal skill. The confusion and distraction created by this whole body attack will open an opponent up far more successfully than predictable localized attacks. Thus if I want a leg submission, I would be well served to vociferously attack the neck and upper body and allow the resultant distraction and reaction to open the door to the legs. Here, kohai student Ethan Crelinsten shows excellent dispersal of attacks in a recent local tournament. He attacks with great determination with armlocks (juji gatame) and strangles (triangle/sankaku) and legs (ashi garami). The barrage of attacks leaves a confused opponent open to a finish via sankaku/juji combination - a fine example of dispersed attacks creating openings for a favorite technique (tokui waza)
