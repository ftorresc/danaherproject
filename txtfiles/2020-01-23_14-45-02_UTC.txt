Jiu Jitsu is not about perfection. Not even the best among us have perfect Jiu Jitsu - nor has anyone in the past and neither will anyone in the future. Jiu Jitsu is about the PURSUIT of perfection through the use of rational thinking in response to the myriad problems we encounter and testing these thoughts physically through trial and error and edging just a little closer every day towards the unattainable dream of perfection. Take confidence in the fact that if victory is all you seek - your Jiu Jitsu doesnâ€™t have to be perfect - it just has to be better than the person in front of you. The real battle however, is not with the person in front of you; but rather with the distant dream of perfection within you and the growth of character and skill required to push yourself daily towards that shimmering dream you know you will never reach but whose pursuit will make you a far better person than those who live without a dream and an ideal.
