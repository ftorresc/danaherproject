One step forward - one step back: Live training at the seminar today finished with a disappointment. Garry Tonon took a small but deep cut to the forehead during sparring - we are off to local hospital now ðŸ˜ž Hoping to get some stitches in quickly but it's going to be a while until Garry can train again, so Worlds competition is in jeopardy at this point ðŸ˜ž We will have a better idea of situation after we spoke to local doctors - off to Birmingham hospital now
