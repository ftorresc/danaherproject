Gordon Ryan just released his new instructional video SYSTEMATICALLY ATTACKING THE TURTLE POSITION. This is an incredibly detailed and complete dissection of the postion by the best no gi back attack expert I ever saw. Like all my senior students, Mr Ryan is every bit as good at teaching as he is in competition and he shows it here in this video. I put a very high value on independent thinking and strongly encourage it in my students. All my senior students have developed their own unique approaches and details to the game I taught them and have gone beyond my teachings to develop their own personal game - Mr Ryan shows his approach to the back attack game that made him such a super star in the world grappling. If you want to become an outright assassin from the back who can take the back, hold the back and finish from the back - this is an asset that you will cherish for many years. Check out his Instagram bio for links and see if this can take you closer to your Jiu Jitsu goals! ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ
