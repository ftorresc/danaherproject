One of the great balance breaking methods in Jiu Jitsu: Pull the upper body with your arms and push the lower body with your legs - they will stumble every time - and if you can stumble the man then you can sweep the man! When you look at the photo you will see lines of tension running through my training partners gi jacket - indicating a pulling action on my part. In addition you can see tension in my right leg as it extends - indicating a pushing action on my part. Performed at the same time on a vulnerable spot you can see the inevitable result - a stumble and fall on my training partners part. When it comes time to break balance, only the COMBINED action of push and pull will have the effect you seek. Pushing on the legs without pulling on the head and upper body is worthless. So too, is pulling on the head without pushing on the legs. However, when you combine the two - magic can happen and you can stumble the biggest men in the gym.
