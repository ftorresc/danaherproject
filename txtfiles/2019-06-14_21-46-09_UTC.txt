Don’t forget your legs! It’s very in Jiu Jitsu to get tunnel vision as we close in on a favorite attack. This is natural and not entirely a bad a thing - focus and relentless pursuit of a goal often creates success. Sometimes however, that focus on a narrow possibility blinds us to easier or better options that are right in front of us. A classic example often occurs with the most high percentage submission in the sport - the rear strangle. Because it is such a great submission it’s natural to focus entirely upon it when we get behind people. As long as our chest is locked to an opponent’s scapula that’s all good - but should an opponent start sliding down lower towards our stomach, start thinking about the other great strangle option from the back that ought to be used much more - the rear triangle (ushiro sankaku) - where we can utilize the tremendous power of the legs to impart truly impressive strangulation pressure. Here, Nicky Ryan drills the transition from arm strangle to leg strangle - and as a bonus will also now have opportunities to add various joint locks into the action as he does so. Keep your options open - as much as we all love arm strangles, don’t ignore the great effectiveness of leg strangles.
