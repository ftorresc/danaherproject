Make sure you’re immune to your own poison: An odd thing about combat sports is that quite often (not always) athletes who excel at a given move are themselves surprisingly vulnerable to that same move. This might be because everyone they train with us so fearful of that move that the athlete in question never gets to practice defending it himself. So for example, when Garry Tonon fought Rousimar Palhares, a man greatly feared for his leg locks, I encouraged him to immediately attack Mr Palhares’s legs. If you have favorite moves - make sure you know both sides of them - attack AND defense. Only when you know both aspects can you rightly be described as a master of the position. Here, Gordon Ryan, master of back attacks, Does his time with the other half of back, mastery - defense
