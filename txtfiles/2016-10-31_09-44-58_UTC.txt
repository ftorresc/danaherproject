Next assignment: After a great weekend in England, where Garry Tonon defeated two time world champion Gilbert Burns via heel hook, it's back to NYC for four days of training getting Gordon Ryan ready for EBI 9 in Los Angeles California. Mr Ryan has been training diligently in the shadow of Mr Tonon's big show at Polaris, but now takes center stage on the training mats for this heavyweight event where he will be by far the smallest competitor. We are headed to Heathrow airport now then back to the mats in NYC ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š Great to see the burgeoning BJJ scene in The UK and the rising success of a professional grappling league - Polaris - this bodes well for the future of British and European grappling.
