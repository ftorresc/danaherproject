The return of Nicky Ryan: Nicky Ryan returns to the big stage in England this weekend at @polaris_professional Polaris 8 grappling event. He will take on Japanese Leg Lock icon Masakazu Imanari. Squad senior Garry Tonon defeated Mr Imanari previously via heel hook but this is a very different situation as Mr Ryan is considerably smaller and only seventeen years old. As always, Mr Ryan has prepared with maturity beyond his years and is well prepared. Canâ€™t wait to see these two high level submission experts go to work!
