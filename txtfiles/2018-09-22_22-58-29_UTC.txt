Principles versus techniques: The underlying PRINCIPLES of jiu jitsu , and indeed, all combat sports, are as fixed and permanent as the night sky; for they are rooted in the unchanging strengths and weaknesses of the human body. The TECHNIQUES of jiu jitsu on the other hand, change with the speed and fluidity of the waters of a river, as they are based upon the minds of men who forever seek competitive advantage over each other through insight, study and innovation. Accordingly, stay true to the basic principles at all times, they will give you sound direction with the reliability of a compass; but recognize that techniques must be in flux, with constant change and innovation in response to a changing landscape.
