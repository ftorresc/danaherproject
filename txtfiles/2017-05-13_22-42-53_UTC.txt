Foreign operations: Kohai (apprentice) squad member, part of our formidable Canadian contingent (but with European ancestry) Oliver Taza, has an outstanding day in competition this weekend. He won the European trials for the ADCC world Grappling championships and has secured his ticket to Finland later in the year to battle the best grapplers on the planet. He fought four times, winning three via his tokui- waza (favorite technique) the inverted or inside heel hook. Along the way he defeated two black belts (Mr Taza is only a recent brown belt), both are former European champions. Here is some video footage taken from the final (sorry about the far away perspective- it's the best we have available) where Mr Taza combines Sumi gaeshi sacrifice throw with a nice step into cross ashi garami to secure his heel hook and the win. Great work by our two Canadian standouts Mr Taza and Mr Crelinsten to qualify for the world championships and represent their nation and our approach to the sport.
