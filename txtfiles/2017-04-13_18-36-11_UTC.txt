Gordon Ryan will be teaching a seminar featuring techniques and strategies used by the squad and in addition, his own unique methods that he has independently created and which he uses with great effect both in the gym and in competition. I am very proud to see one of my students teaching at the new gym of my 1990's RGA team mate, Shawn Williams - what better way to launch the new school! Californians will get a chance to see Our approach to the sport that Mr Ryan has done so much to showcase.
