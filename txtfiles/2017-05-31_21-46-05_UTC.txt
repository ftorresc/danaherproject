Old friends: An unexpected surprise in Singapore as I got to meet an old friend from some of Georges St-Pierre's fight camps, Kru Yod. The full story of our meeting is too long for an Instagram post, so I put it on my Facebook page - you are welcome to check it out there. Kru Yod is a very successful trainer at Evolve gym now. He was a big part of the preparation for Mr St-Pierre's bouts with Carlos Condit and Nick Diaz. It was great catching up with an old friend and seeing positive changes in his life. If you have time, see my Facebook page for details on the story of these remarkable Thai trainers.
