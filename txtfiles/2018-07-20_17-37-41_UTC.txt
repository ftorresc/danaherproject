Bound for the Pacific: At JFK airport bound for Manila, Philippines via Korea. Mr Tonon has trained hard as always. Thanks so much to all our team mates, sparring partners and mentors. Looking forward to getting back to the Asian martial arts scene and the team at @onechampionship as they continue to showcase MMA throughout Asia and growing in the West as well ðŸ˜Š looking forward to doing what I can to help the BJJ scene in Manila while in town and catching up with comrades Tom DeBlass and Sensei Renzoâ€™s team. Wishing you all the best! Thanks so much for your interest in what we do and how we do it! Back system video will be released next week - I wonâ€™t be here for that, but hope you all enjoy it anyway! ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—
