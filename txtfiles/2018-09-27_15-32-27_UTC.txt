Great morning training with @chrisweidman along with @gordonlovesjiujitsu and @wonderboymma Three of the most talented athletes I ever met. The application of jiu jitsu to MMA is a theme that my sensei, Renzo Gracie, always encouraged me to pursue and emphasize. I am blessed to do so with such talent as this. What an introduction to aspects of MMA training for Gordon Ryan - working with titans from the start!
