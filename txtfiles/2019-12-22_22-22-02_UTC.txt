Controlling the Action/reaction reflex is the single most artful aspect of Jiu Jitsu: It is not difficult to perform most of the moves of Jiu Jitsu in an unresisting drilling partner. It is much more difficult to apply them in a competitive sparring session against an opponent. As the skill level of the opponent rises so to does the degree of difficulty of applying moves. What will make the make the difference is your ability to get past his knowledge and ability to anticipate your moves and counter them. This is where Jiu Jitsu becomes truly artful. You want him to move a certain way and he knows that and so resists strongly. The only way for you to win is to use his defensive reactions in your favor. This is a lifetime study, but a great way to start this project is the simple rule of opposites so often mentioned by the old masters. IF YOU WANT AN OPPONENT TO MOVE AWAY FROM YOU - BEGIN BY PULLING HIM TOWARDS YOU. IF YOU WANT AN OPPONENT TO MOVE TOWARDS YOU, BEGIN MY PUSHING HIM AWAY FROM YOU. As your opponent resists the initial force, take him is the same direction as his resistance - which of course is where you really wanted him to go all along. Here, I want to knock a standing opponent backwards with a sweep from open guard. I begin with a pull on his arm courtesy of a two on one grip. He digs his heels into the mat and resists - NOW is the time to knock him backwards. Most of the impetus backwards actually comes from my opponents resistance to the initial pull. I just have to complete what he has started. Learn to think this way in all of your Jiu Jitsu and you will defeat people through artistry and skill rather than strength and power.
