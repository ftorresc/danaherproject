Jiu jitsu and friendship: Though the purpose of jiu jitsu is ostensibly that of controlling an opponent in ways that lead to his submission, there are other elements involved in the study of the art that run deeper than this. Perhaps the most important is friendship. Jiu jitsu is fought alone against a single opponent, but it is practiced in a community. That community, due to its strong sense of shared goals, frustrations, hopes, dreams, fears, failures and successes, becomes extremely tight. When one of our number falls, we all feel the jolt. One of RGAâ€™s most beloved students, the inestimable and highly unorthodox black belt Shy Aces, has a dear friend who has fallen upon hard times and needs help. Garry Tonon, Gordon Ryan and myself will teach a seminar in our home gym - The Renzo Gracie Academy in Manhattan- to help raise funds for Shy Aces friend. It will be this Saturday at RGA at 11am until 1pm. We will be showing our approach to jiu jitsu to anyone interested in coming by. You can call RGA or contact Shy Aces on Facebook (yep, thereâ€™s only one ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ). Shy tells me itâ€™s nearly sold out now but we will do our best to get you in. Gordon Ryan will teach tasteful tattoo selection, social media decorum and manners, modesty training for young adults and how to avoid overdosing on protein powder. Garry Tonon will teach hair coloring technique, how not to drive an automobile if you wish to live a long life, and prioritizing chicks over cash and championships. Shy Aces will teach an introduction to car jacking and high speed chase strategies. I will teach some jiu jitsu. Hope you can make it if you are in the city! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
