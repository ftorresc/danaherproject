If you’ve got a mat - you’ve got a dojo: I’ve travelled the world and seen every kind of gym from the most plush to the most primitive, in the wealthiest countries and the poorest. I’ve seen that the gym doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters is you and the people around you. If you have passion, knowledge and a plan to transform that knowledge into skill, along with the discipline to stay with that plan and the wisdom to modify it when necessary - you can achieve remarkable things. People count - places don’t. Your path to your potential is in you and the people around you, not the building you’re in. Here, Garry Tonon and Gordon Ryan work out in a dusty old VA warehouse with some mats on the floor in a small town - the next night Gordon Ryan won his third EBI title. You can get a victory building workout anywhere
