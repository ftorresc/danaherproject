Submission holds: The various submission holds are the most distinctive and revered element of jiu jitsu - a fact revealed by the point system of the sport. You can be losing a match by any number of points, but if you are able to lock in a successful submission hold, the match is yours. No other part of the sport is valued so highly. Each of the submissions has its own unique character, which helps explain why so many jiu jitsu players are very good at some, yet surprisingly weak with others. Gaining deep knowledge of the nature and application of each of the main submission holds is a huge part of your ultimate progress in the sport. Like a large and disparate family, they are all related, yet quite different from each other.
Among the main joint locks, the most basic distinction is among the linear locks and the twisting locks. Here I demonstrate a fairly standard variation of ude garami, commonly known as "Kimura" in BJJ parlance. This belongs in the category of twisting locks and is among the most important and effective of the upper body submissions. One of its great hallmarks is its versatility; being equally useful gi or no gi, in both standing and ground grappling, from either top or bottom positions, as both a means of submission and as a means of control, as either an end in itself or as a lead in to other techniques
