Back in action: Garry Tonon celebrates another submission win via heel hook over the very talented champion and coach, Dustin Akbari. The match was made more interesting by the fact that Mr Akbari had narrowly defeated Mr Tonon when Mr Tonon was a brown belt. The rematch offered a chance to gauge Mr Tonon's skill development since that time and the progressive nature of our training system. The match featured some excellent throws by Mr Akbari and half guard sweeps from Mr Tonon. In the end however, the game is always about control leading to submission and in this direction, Mr Tonon showed an interesting use of a scorpion ("lockdown " to 10th planet fans) to generate kuzushi (off balancing) into a submission hold - one of his favorite heel hook variations. Here he celebrates with the victors belt for Fight To Win, who put on a nice event and continue to grow as an organization
