Coping with loss: All competitive athletes reaching upwards will have to learn to deal with losing. It does not matter whether it's on the big stage, in the gym, at the onset of your program or at your peak - it happens to everyone - no exceptions. I am often asked by people how they should deal with loss. There are two main problems here. The first is important in the immediate aftermath of a loss. Here the main problem is EMOTIONAL - the problem is not why it happened, but THAT It happened. As time passes, the emotional phase gets replaced by the REFLECTIVE phase - the athlete begins to reflect upon WHY the loss happened. Then we must analyze ourselves deeply and distinguish between a faulty training program and a good training program that the athlete failed to adhere to. That is a big topic - too big for an Instagram post (even for me! ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜œ) With regards the emotional phase I always say the same thing "YOU FOUGHT BRAVELY AND WITH FINE TECHNIQUE, GIVING EVERYTHING YOU HAD, BOTH IN PREPARATION AND THE BOUT ITSELF. THERE IS NOTHING MORE YOU CAN ASK OF YOURSELF AS A MAN, NOR ANYTHING MORE THE AUDIENCE CAN ASK OF YOU AS AN ATHLETE- NOW, LET'S GO FORWARD TOGETHER.
