I see much to admire in the Japanese model of classroom structure. It is based around the distinction between senpai (senior students) and kohai (junior students). The seniors take the biggest challenges and represent the school in the big shows. They provide the inspiration through their skills and deeds to the juniors and assist in the dissemination of knowledge through the training room. Equally important and far greater in number are the kohai. These students are a tier down in experience and skill level, but working their way up. They are absolutely critical in the contest preparation of the senpai and in building a strong training program which can build them into future senpai. The kohai often work in obscurity as they must first prove themselves in small local shows and work their way through merit into the ranks of the senpai. In every tough gym you will see this division occur naturally and organically, even when no one is trying to make it happen. This weekend several of our kohai emerged from the gym and put on stellar displays that show how their hard work and time with the senpai has hardened them and refined their skills. Ethan Crelinsten won first place at Sapeteiro 5 featherweight winning all matches by submission in regulation time (EBI rules). Eric Sherman and Frankie Adam Rosenthal shared first place at Grappling Industries show in NYC yesterday - winning all via heel hook. At the same show Emmanuelle Vera won first place in expert division, every match via heel hook - he is only a blue belt! Watching them train so hard with the senpai every day is a privilege for me, a benefit for them, and a necessity for the senpai. As always, THE BEST KIND OF BENEFIT IS MUTUAL BENEFIT. The relationship between senpai and kohai is the perfect example of this. It was great to see the kohai have their time in the sun yesterday and show the fruit of their labor.
