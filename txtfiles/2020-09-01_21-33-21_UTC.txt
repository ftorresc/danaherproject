Donâ€™t be satisfied with teaching moves - go further and teach a PHILOSOPHY of moves - a holistic approach that asks WHY moves are performed as well as HOW. Then when your students look at a performance they see so much more than a series of moves - they see why one athlete is winning and the other losing - and they can take that as a lesson to create their own victories. Many will LOOK, but only a few will really SEE.
