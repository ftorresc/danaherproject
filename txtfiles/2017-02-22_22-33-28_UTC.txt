Drilling for perfection: An interesting feature of our sport is that when moves are performed well, there is a feeling of "fitting in correctly" that is unmistakable. Even relatively inexperienced students can feel a well performed move locking into place. So too, imperfections are obvious to perceive as your partner can wriggle free easily by exploiting whatever mechanical imperfections you have made. When drilling, STUDENTS MUST BE MINDFUL OF ACTIVELY SEEKING TO FIND THAT PERFECT "FIT IN" WHERE  THE GEOMETRY OF THEIR BODY FITS EFFECTIVELY INTO THE GEOMETRY OF THEIR WORKOUT PARTNERS BODY IN A WAY THAT CREATES THE TIGHTNESS OF FIT THAT ENSURES SUCCESS. That is why I don't have my students drill for numbers of repetitions or for time. When numbers or time are the goal they will focus on that rather than on mechanical form. When I see mechanical form is at a satisfactory level - I move them on to something else - I am not guided by time or numbers. Here Georges St-Pierre works on his front triangle (omote sankaku) on a standing opponent - a situation that requires particularly close attention to correct mechanical form if it is to succeed
