Three great entry points into submission 
Ashi garami
Front headlock
Kimura 
The game of Jiu jitsu has a dizzying array of moves, tactics, principles etc and in the hurly burly of sparring or competition it can be very difficult to remember what to do. Whenever confusion reigns - SIMPLIFY. If you are searching for submission in a dynamic and chaotic situation - focus on the three best entry and most accessible entry points that will give you a tight hold on even a very challenging opponent and get you in a position to start threatening submissions. These are ASHI GARAMI, KIMURA and FRONT HEADLOCK. Ashi garami will open up a vast number of sweeps, reversals and leg lock submissions. Kimura will open up submissions via Kimura itself, plus juji gatame arm locks, triangles and sweeps/takedowns. Front headlock will give you Guillotine, Darce, Anaconda strangles (among others) and transitions to the back along with many takedowns. In a chaotic and confusing scramble - stay focused on these three control grips - they are almost always available at some point, and will get on the short cut to submission! Here, Craig Jones, a young master of Ashi garami, gets a deep bite on his opponents leg that points him a situation to attack with leg locks and sweeps and immediately gets his opponent into a defensive mindset.
