Isolation: The most impressive displays of strength from the human body all involve the unity of the body working as a whole, arms, legs and core moving with unity of purpose. Our bodies are strong when they are unified. When it comes time to play the game of Jiu jitsu you want to reduce your opponents strength to the greatest degree possible. The best way to do this is to isolate his limbs. A single limb in isolation is not  strong. THE ESSENCE OF JIU JITSU IS TO MATCH THE UNIFIED STRENGTH OF YOUR WHOLE BODY AGAINST THE ISOLATED WEAKNESS OF AN OPPONENTS SINGLE LIMB - whether it be leg, arm or neck. If you can do this you can make a strong man weak and easy to control.
