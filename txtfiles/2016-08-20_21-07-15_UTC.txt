The big show: There is nothing like a big prize fight to get people's attention. All of the world's great sports have their appeal - but none of them have such a primal appeal as fighting. Other sports are ritualized, sublimated combat, but a prize fight is combat itself - so much more basic and direct. Love it or hate it - no one will ignore it when it unfolds in front of them. It is like a look back at our common ancestral past and as such, we are all involved at some level. The appeal seems to treble when the two protagonists appear to genuinely dislike each other. I believe this is because most people enter and understand violence on an emotional level. Most people only get into confrontation when their emotions are aroused. A professional fighter must be able to fight cold, even against someone they like. For him or her it is a contest of skills. Most people have a hard time relating to this as they lack the technical knowledge of fighting to understand what is going on - but emotions everyone can understand - hence the appeal. The fighters themselves must be very careful in these circumstances. Managing the emotions prior to and during the fight is absolutely vital to success - many a fighter has drowned in the exhaustion of nervous energy in an overly emotional fight. Tonight's match between Mr Diaz and Mr McGregor will be a fascinating example of an emotionally charged fight where emotion and professionalism must be reconciled.
