Control time: Time is a huge factor in combat sports in many different ways. In grappling one of the most important facets of time is what we might call CONTROL TIME - this is the amount of time you can maintain control over the movement of a resisting opponent in a position that leads directly into submission. THE LONGER YOU CAN MAINTAIN CONTROL TIME UNDER STRESS, THE MORE LIKELY YOU WILL GO ON TO SUBMIT YOUR OPPONENT, particularly if you can make multiple attempts at submissions from that control position. There is a direct relationship between the amount of time you can consistently control opponents in positions that lead directly to submission and your submission rate. Take your favorite positions from which you can transition directly to submission - ashi garami, Kimura, front headlock, juji gatame - whatever you want - AND PRACTICE HOLDING OPPONENTS IN THISE POSITIONS UNDER CONTROL FOR EXTENDED PERIODS - if you get a submission- release and keep going. When you can hold and control these winning positions for minutes at a time there will be very few people who will be able to stop your submission offense.
