The only thing better than one well applied force is two well applied forces: A central concept in Jiu Jitsu is directionality of force. A force applied in the right direction at the right time can produce spectacular effects, whilst that same force applied in an inappropriate direction will produce negligible results. The greatest effects come when you learn to couple forces - to apply forces in opposing directions at the same time upon your opponent. This creates powerful turning forces that can greatly amplify the effects of submissions, sweeps and takedowns. Look for this whenever you can - Jiu Jitsu is full of examples. A scissor is a fine example of this principle in everyday life. Jiu Jitsu takes that same mechanical principle and applied it in variations of the scissor sweep. Here I use a spider guard variation of the scissor sweep to create a considerable turning force upon a training partner. Whenever you see opportunity to use this principle - and there a MANY in Jiu Jitsu - use it and emphasize it - you will like the results!
