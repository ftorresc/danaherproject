Morning class: Nothing wakes a person up faster than a man highly skilled in the arts of strangulation and joint breaking doing his best to do exactly that to you. The troops at RGA NYC go at it in sparring rounds (randori) while the rest of the big apple slowly wakes up outside. Georges St-Pierre works elements of back attack and ashi garami systems with Eddie Cummings and Garry Tonon in some hard fought rounds as the action unfolds across the room. The unifying factor across the room - performance improvement in the kingly art. Some are professional athletes with specific upcoming goals, others are amateurs with a more general goal of skill enhancement- but the path forward is the same for both - increasing knowledge and embedding that knowledge in a set of physical skills that can bring you closer to those goals.
