Homeward bound: At the airport in San Francisco waiting for connecting flight back to NYC! Canâ€™t wait to get back on the mat with the squad and all my students in the blue basement Wednesday morning we are back in the saddle - lots of big projects coming up and lots of dreams to be realized! See you there! ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ
