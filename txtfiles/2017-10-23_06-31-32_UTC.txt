Flawless victory: Garry Tonon won an unprecedented fifth EBI title here in LA tonight - every match by submission - three heel hooks and a sankaku (triangle) variation to win the maximum possible prize - Twenty thousand shekels. It was one of the most impressive performances in the history of the event. Mr Tonon defeated the man he narrowly lost to via points at ADCC - Wagner Rocha - but tonight he turned it around with a brutal heel hook variation to win a decisive victory. The tightness and power of his locks was matched only by the relaxed fluidity of his positional movements into attack positions. We are all so proud of his tremendous achievement. Congratulations also to some other incredible performances tonight. 10th planet athletes, PJ Barch and Nathan Orchard went through some absolute wars to make their way up the tournament brackets. Old rival Wagner Rocha had some incredibly tough matches and prevailed all the way through to the final. It made for a very exciting event overall that was a pleasure@to be a small part of. Hope you all enjoyed the show. Now itâ€™s back to NYC to prepare for Georges St-Pierre back in the UFC and then Garry Tonon in a combat jiu jitsu event back here in LA! Thanks again to Eddie Bravo and Victor Davila for putting on another amazing show and helping take this great sport to a new level.
