Dual threats: Quite often when attacking with submission holds you can create a threat with two submissions at the same time. As an opponent goes to defend one - he falls victim to the other. Usually one strong submission is more than enough but when the opportunity to attack simultaneously with two arises - you are wise to take it. Think about a triangle attack - whenever you have it you almost always have a simultaneous opportunity to attack with juji gatame armbar, kimura or wrist lock. Here, Garry Tonon uses a specialized ashi garami variation to create a simultaneous threat of knee bar on one leg and figure four toe hold on the other to take a fine submission win over Ralek Gracie. Every submission hold can be used in SEQUENCE as part of a combination attack - but only a select few can be attacked SIMULTANEOUSLY. Make sure you know them - even though are relatively rare, they can be an extremely valuable addition to your submission arsenal
