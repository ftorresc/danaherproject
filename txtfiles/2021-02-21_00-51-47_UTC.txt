Control the hips: The only scoring position from the back in Jiu Jitsu is rear mount. This involves hooking your two legs into your opponents hips. There are many other back controls that don’t involve the legs at all. They don’t score but are nonetheless very useful methods of control that can win matches. My favorite involve the use of tight waist grips that offer direct control of an opponents hip with an arm. It does a fine job of giving you hip to hip connection along with a great ability to off balance an opponent and leaves you with a free arm that can be put anywhere in response to rapid changes as the match unfolds. When you don’t have hooks in - throw in a tight waist grip as an excellent means of dynamic control
