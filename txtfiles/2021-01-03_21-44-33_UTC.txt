Who is this tiny terror?? Itâ€™s BABY NICKY RYAN!! His Mom is in Puerto Rico and was proudly showing baby photos of her sons to the squad when this one came up!! Looks to me like that little demon is getting ready to slide into ashi garami from standing and break some poor souls leg!! Garry Tonon thinks he practicing toddler single legs in the play pen. Was this little maniac practicing the dark arts of leg locking at age 1? Damn! No wonder he got so good so quickly!! One thing i know for sure - if baby Nicky meets baby Yoda itâ€™s going to be a bad day for the little green guys leg!! Even the force wonâ€™t be enough to save him from this maniacs heel hooks! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
