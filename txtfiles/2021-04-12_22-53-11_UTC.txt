Extension: The essential feature of successful submission attempts is always extension of the limb being attacked away from the torso to a degree that renders it vulnerable. The hardest people to submit are those who contract their limbs in tight to the torso (though by doing so they render themselves vulnerable to other methods of attack). When it’s time to lock joints or strangle necks - extension is the ingredient you need. Extended limbs don’t stay extended for long in a competitive match - so once you see it - trap it in place. Here, Nicky Ryan latches on to an extended arm in a way that will make extraction difficult and as a result he has a number of great submission opportunities in front of him. Now it’s time to make a decision as to which option he will take - that of course, is up to you - we all have our favorites - but the one commonality between all those choices will be prior extension of the limb - focus on that first.
