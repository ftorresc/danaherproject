Push and pull: Every grappling exchange has a beginning based around establishing grip. Once that is attained it’s natural to want to go straight into your attacks. That can certainly work, but often you are well advised to start with a brief period of PUSH and PULL that creates the possibility of ACTION and REACTION. Learning to play constructively with those reactions to your pushing and pulling is one of the biggest steps you can make in your grappling journey. Next time you lock up with your partner, don’t rush to your moves. Start with a brief period of push and pull using both arms and legs and try to feed of the reactions you get and use those reactions to enter your moves. Adding that intermediary step of push and pull - no matter how brief - will add a whole new dimension of attacking skills to your game
