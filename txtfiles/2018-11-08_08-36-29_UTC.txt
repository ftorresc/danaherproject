MMA star Sage Northcutt works back and triangle systems: we had a blast here in Singapore today working back and triangle systems and got an unexpected visit from Sage Northcutt @supersagenorthcutt who I have not seen since his days at Tristar gym. He did a fine job of working some complex moves - here he works the rear triangle (ushiro sankaku) - looks like he killed his partner with it! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ He is a fine athlete and quickly picked up these new skills. Garry Tonon successfully made weight at 155 pounds - his first outing at the new weight for @onechampionship . Now he is feeding like a lion back at the hotel! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ I just finished teaching for the day at  @evolvemma - I will go back and see if he left any scraps for me ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Wishing you all the best from Singapore!
