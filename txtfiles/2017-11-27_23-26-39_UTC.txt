Back in training: After the excitement of Gordon Ryan’s victory in Torrance yesterday The squad was back in the gym today, joined by Keenan Cornelius. Here, Mr Ryan battles Mr Cornelius while Nicky Ryan goes toe to toe with Garry Tonon in the training cage at Musclepharm HQ in LA. Mr Ryan is preparing for a very tough field in Texas this weekend at EBI 14 Open weight tournament while his younger brother will take on outstanding 10th Planet Black belt Ricky Lule here in LA Friday night.  This evening it will be more grappling training and then MMA work for Mr Tonon. In jiu jitsu as in life, the higher your goals and aspirations, the more you must demand of yourself. The more you want - the more you must give - in sweat and effort. When people TALK to me about their goals and aspirations, I don’t even listen. I WATCH WHAT THEY ACTUALLY DO TO BRING ABOUT THOSE GOALS AND ASPIRATIONS AND SEE HOW MUCH THEY ARE WILLING TO GIVE IN THE ATTEMPT. Only then will you really see how serious they are.
