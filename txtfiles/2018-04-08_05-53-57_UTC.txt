Enjoying the show: Great UFC tonight in Brooklyn NY. Another very impressive showing by Khabib Nurmagomedov and Zabit Magomedsharipov to show the depth of Russian talent in MMA. Also another tremendous performance by Rose Namajunas to retain her belt in a great boxing vs Muay Thai stylistic match up. Here I am relaxing with my friend, World jiu jitsu champion, Bernardo Faria, who enjoyed his first UFC live show - always a great experience! Hope you all enjoyed the show!
