Party at Renzo's!! My beloved sensei and world's coolest human, Renzo Gracie is celebrating his 20th birthday tonight ğŸ˜‰ğŸ˜œ at his beautiful home in NJ! The whole crew is here and it's wonderful to see so many old friends and laugh about old times and plot new plans ğŸ˜œğŸ˜Š Nights like these remind me of the profound impact my sensei had on so many lives and the value of jiu jitsu outside the dojo. Of course like a bunch of degenerates we are watching the UFC and enjoying old school legend Vitor Belfort mixing it up with new generation athletes - kind of like the party at Renzo's ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜Šenjoying a wonderful party for a wonderful man and his many wondrous achievements ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜Š
