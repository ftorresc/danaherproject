MMA and Jiu Jitsu: The link between the two always fascinates me and reflections upon one often illuminate aspects of the other in unexpected ways. Here some of the MMA standouts at RGA, Rafael Natal, Nieman Gracie, Felipe Nover, Joao Zeferino and friends relax after another tough early Monday morning workout. So strange to think of NYC on a typical Monday morning, millions of people going to office jobs, getting children to school, wondering whether they should add an extra sugar in their coffee or not - whilst these young men practice strangling each other, breaking each other's limbs and getting into position to strike each other - such are the different directions we all choose in life!! ðŸ˜‰ In the end, they are all jobs, and like all jobs, those performed with passion, attention to detail, and expertise gained over time - in an area that you believe enriches your life in some way, will be done best, regardless of what form of work one chooses.
