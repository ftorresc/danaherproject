I am very pleased to announce my participation in another super seminar alongside the great Ben Askren - @onechampionship MMA champion and wrestling icon and Olympian. I will cover jiu jitsu aspects focusing on the squad approach to leg locking and back attacks, whilst Mr Askren covers wrestling applications to grappling and MMA. It will be held October 6 in Schenectady New York. As always, looking forward to showing our approach to jiu jitsu to a new audience!
