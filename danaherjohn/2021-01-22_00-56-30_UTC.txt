What the f**k!!! Iâ€™m filming a new instructional video at BJJ Fanatics when they show me an old painting from an art gallery in downtown Boston that they saw and bought ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ It features British General Richard Savage 4th Earl Rivers. I donâ€™t know who that guy was in history but Iâ€™m pretty damn sure he banged one of my Great great great great Grand mothers thatâ€™s for sure!! ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ I must admit his fashion sense greatly exceeds my own ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ Initially I thought these jokers were pranking me but apparently he really existed!! Iâ€™m thinking of showing up at his ancestors estate in England and demanding a big room ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚
