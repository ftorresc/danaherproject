Mission impossible-Accomplished: Garry Tonon celebrates his third title after winning EBI 9 in dramatic fashion via overtime riding advantage. He fought his way to the finals where he fought the great Vinny Magalhaes, former ADCC champion. It was the toughest EBI yet for Mr Tonon, as he was a last minute replacement for injured team mate, Gordon Ryan. He had just fought under a different rule set a week ago in England and then suffered a small but deep cut that interfered with the little preparation time he had in a weight division far above his own. Yet with characteristic professionalism, skill and gung ho spirit, he battled through to a win over the big men and showed that the true spirit of jiu jitsu - built around the ideal of lesser size and strength controlling and defeating greater size and strength, is not empty talk, but with training and strategy, came to reality on the stage of the Orpheum theater in LA at EBI 9.
