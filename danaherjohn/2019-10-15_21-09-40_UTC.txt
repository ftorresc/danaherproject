Amazing performance by the squad at ADCC 2019: There are four special prizes given out at every ADCC World Championships to recognize great achievements among the many athletes. Best fighter, best match, fastest/best submission and best takedown. Squad athletes won three out of four of those prizes. Gordon Ryan was unstoppable and easily win best fighter award. Garry Tonon has the performances of his life with best match for his barn burner with Renato Canuto and fastest submission over Edwin Najmi. Great to see the amazing performances of these athletes getting official recognition - congratulations to @gordonlovesjiujitsu and @garrytonon
