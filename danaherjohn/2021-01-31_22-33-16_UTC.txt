The undisputed king of positions - the back: As much as I love leg locks and arm locks, if I could only have one submission for the rest of my life I would choose strangles from the back without hesitation.

You can use scrambles to the back when guard passing, as a counter to most leg locks, at the completion of any sweep or takedown, as a follow on from any pin. You could become a dominant world champion with the rear strangle as your only submission hold provided your positional game was up to the task of reliably getting you to the back. Thankfully we donâ€™t have to make the choice of a single submission and so we can learn a bunch of them to make the game easier, but still, lesson learned - study your pathways to the back and your finishes from there - it  will never let you down in any scenario in which you may find yourself.
