Speed: Speed is a wonderful attribute in combat sports. In Jiu jitsu it is probably less important than it is in most other combat sports because most of the action is on the floor where speeds are always much slower than standing position. Nonetheless a very quick opponent definitely creates unique problems even in Jiu jitsu. However, what if you aren’t particularly quick? What are you to do? Understand this - speed of body is great but speed of DECISION MAKING is better. Why? Because if you can make quick mental decisions you can build ANTICIPATION into your game and anticipation will create an artificial speed advantage - not because it makes you faster but because it enables you to START THE RACE EARLIER. If you don’t have the fast body - TRAIN YOURSELF TO HAVE THE FASTEST MIND THAT CAN IDENTIFY A SITUATION AND MAKE A DECISION BEFORE YOUR OPPONENT HAS STARTED MOVING.
