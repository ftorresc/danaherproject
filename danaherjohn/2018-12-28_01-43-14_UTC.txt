Finished!! After two big days of filming we just completed the final installment of the biggest selling Jiu Jitsu video instructionals of all time - the ENTER THE SYSTEM series. Today we completed the Arm Bar (juji gatame)  installment. This is the sixth and last in the series. These six submissions systems, Legs, back, kimura, front headlock/guillotine, triangle and now arm bar are the main submission systems that I teach in no gi grappling and which my students did such an incredible job of applying in top level competition. The triangle system will be released next (early January) and editing of the arm bar footage will now begin. Thanks so much to BJJ Fanatics for their work in filming over the last two days. My students excel in the use of arm bar attacks - I hope that soon you will too!! ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ
