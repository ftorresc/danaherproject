Squad gets a wake up call on how they have been living a lie of butt scooting tom foolery and leg locking cowardice courtesy of Master Ken: Master Ken showed up in Puerto Rico to a squad training session and gave some encouraging words of advice and mentorship as he described us as “a bunch of weirdos with a foot fetish and a proclivity to hump each other’s legs,” and advised us to practice a real martial art instead. We will definitely start incorporating the throat punches and cock destructions he demonstrated in future training sessions and possibly the next Who’s Number One competition - looking forward to tomorrow’s training session!
