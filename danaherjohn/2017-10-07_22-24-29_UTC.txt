Back to our roots: The squad initially made its name in the submission only grappling scene. That was a deliberate policy on our part. My three main students, Eddie Cummings, Garry Tonon and Gordon Ryan were adherents of my belief that jiu jitsu must be understood as control that leads to submission. Submission only tournaments were the best way to express our approach to jiu jitsu and bring attention to it. Our favorite venue was EBI as it offered an exciting rule set, well run organization and great visibility. Since then, the squad has moved into other rule sets and venues with great success, but we never forgot where we started and what we stand for. Coming up soon we go back to our roots for EBI 13 The lightweights. Garry Tonon returns to the Orpheum theater against a stacked field including outstanding ADCC world championships medalists, Wagner Rocha and AJ Agazarm, two 10th planets standouts, former EBI champion, Nathan Orchard along with the extremely talented PJ Barch Also there will be Bill Cooper - former EBI finalist - and as with every EBI, new talented athletes fighting to make their way into the upper echelons. Mr Tonon is beginning his journey into MMA now, but is anxious to train hard and put in another strong showing in the event that did so much to spur his development. Keep your eyes on this one! Itâ€™s going to be a great show!
