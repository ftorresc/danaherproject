Make sure you know the antidote to your own poisons...We all have our favorite submissions. As you get better at them you will inevitably run into opponents who see their effectiveness and want to use them against you as you have against them. Itâ€™s very important you know as much about DEFENDING your favorite submissions as you do attacking. There is an added benefit to this training. Learning to defend a submission is like learning it backwards - it offers fresh perspectives on a move you already know and makes you look at the move from different angles and points of view that often boosts your knowledge for offense as well as defense. Know your moves from the perspective of both attacker AND defender and you will gain deeper knowledge and avoid falling victim to your own poison!
