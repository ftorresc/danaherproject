It can’t all be hard work and suffering: Sometimes visitors to our gym are rather surprised by the amount of banter and wisecracking there is before and after class. I’m very much in favor of this. When it’s time to work - work hard - but when it’s over it’s important to have some fun (usually at each other’s expense 😜😜). Overly formal atmospheres always felt a little uncomfortable to me. I always disliked titles like “Professor” or even worse “master.” I always felt that an informal and relaxed atmosphere that nonetheless had a clear sense of when it was time to knuckle down and get the hard work done and when it was ok to joke around got the right balance of industry and relaxation that made training in a tough sport enjoyable. Some of my favorite memories in Jiu jitsu came from times AFTER class and that’s a healthy thing as laughter and fun have probably brought more students back for tomorrow’s workout than workouts ever did. Just make sure it doesn’t degenerate into comedy when you’re supposed to be doing the hard work - but once the final round is done there is as much benefit in laughter as there is in technique
