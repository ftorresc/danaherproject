The old saying is that there are only two certainties in life - death and taxes. Those are certainly two things of which we may be completely certain - but let me propose a third - IF YOU EVER GET A HOLD OF BOTH OF YOUR OPPONENTS LEGS (particularly at the ankles) AND PUSH HIM IN SOME WAY - HE WILL FALL TO HIS BUTT. Whenever you have an opponent in your open guard who just seems unsweepable (not sure if thatâ€™s really a word but Iâ€™ll go with it ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ) - GO BACK TO THIS PRINCIPLE. Research ways to get a hold on both ankles from guard whether with hands or feet or both and push - you will bring him down every time I promise you. That doesnâ€™t mean you will always score - you have to get up and reverse him for that - but itâ€™s a step in the right direction!
