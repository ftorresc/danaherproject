Getting the squad back together: I have been running away from crocodiles and snakes in Australia, Mr Cummings has been living grappling samurai fantasy in Japan, Gordon And Nicky Ryan have been California cruising and Mr Tonon has been trying to push people in some grappling matches with crazy rules in Florida. Now it's time to get serious about training again in good old NYC! ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜Š Can't wait to get back to Old Glory! Does our great country have problems? Yep. Are we perfect? Hell no. But still would not live anywhere else ğŸ˜ŠğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ˜Š "The greatest" does not imply perfection.
America is a work in progress. Our founding fathers gave us a tremendous starting vision, but there is still so much to be done. Can't wait to get back and be a part of it ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸
