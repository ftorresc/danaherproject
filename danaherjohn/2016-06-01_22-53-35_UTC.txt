Tangled up in legs: "Ashi garami" is usually translated as "leg entanglement." It captures well the idea of two of my legs immobilizing one of my opponents legs in ways that make submission attacks and positional sweeps possible. There are many variations, each with distinctive properties that make them good for some purposes, weak in others. Here I work to control the legs with an ashi garami variation on Eddie Cummings - never an easy thing as Mr Cummings is himself a young master of ashi garami, having taken on with great attention and passion every lesson on the subject I ever taught him in a way that quickly took him to the top echelons of the leg locking world. In a situation like this even very small errors have have dramatic and devastating consequences - yet Mr Cummings displays the calm and technical nuance associated with success in this position.
