You can't keep a good man down forever: It extremely pleasing to see Demian Maia get one of the most well deserved title shots in UFC history against juggernaut Tyron Woodley. Mr Maia had an unusually difficult path to welterweight contention, probably due to his Grappling based fighting style which clashes somewhat with the UFC brand image. Despite numerous setbacks and disappointments, Mr Maia never resorted to the usual antics used to jump ahead of the line. Instead he focused upon one thing - winning. Seven straight wins against the best people in the division, mostly by crushing submission. The UFC has been the only major MMA organization that made money and had longevity. They did that by cannily observing what makes people want to watch a pay per view. The answer for the vast majority of fans is simple - drama and violence. Fighters that offer those two will always generate sales. Mr Maia is remarkable because he deliberately eschews both. He prefer bloodless checkmate victories and speaks in the most respectful manner to friend and foe alike. I have had the honor of coaching two athletes in preparation for bouts against Mr Maia, Chris Weidman and Rory MacDonald. I found the experience, from observing his subtle skills and game planning/countering against it, pre and post fight encounters etc to be among the most interesting and rewarding of my coaching career. When in NYC training with his great friend, Marcelo Garcia, he will often stop by RGA to say hello to my dear Sensei, Renzo Gracie. You simply could not hope to meet a nicer person. I have always believed that every great mans life tells a story. The message of Mr Maia's journey is clear. STAY TRUE TO WHO YOU ARE AND ONE DAY YOU WILL NOT ONLY GET TO YOUR GOAL, BUT HAVE THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING YOU GOT THERE ON YOUR OWN TERMS. DON'T CHANGE YOURSELF TO PLEASE THE FRIVOLOUS LIKES AND DISLIKES OF A CROWD WHOSE AFFECTIONS CHANGE WITH THE WIND. BETTER TO BE ADMIRED BY FEWER FOR WHAT YOU REALLY ARE THAN WATCHED BY MORE FOR PRETENDING TO BE WHAT THEY WANTED YOU TO BE. Best of luck to both these great athletes. Regardless of outcome, Mr Maia will always have my unstinting admiration.
