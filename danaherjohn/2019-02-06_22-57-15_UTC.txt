Thumbs up if you like strangling people with your legs! MMA star Sage Northcutt enters the system at a seminar I held in Singapore with @evolvemma The rear triangle (ushiro sankaku) is the second most important triangle in my sankaku system (front triangle is number one) and a fantastic way to utilize the impressive strangling power of the legs to finish highly resistant opponents. Unlike strangles with the arms, there is no need to penetrate under the jaw (a constant source of frustration for many athletes attacking the back) and in addition, a great set of alternative finishes if the strangle should prove ineffective. There is no clearer example of using your legs to overwhelm and control a portion of your opponents upper body - the ideal of all good Jiu Jitsu - that gets a thumbs up from all of us!
