Hands: Whenever you are working for the major upper body body submissions - be aware that in the majority of cases, YOUR OPPONENTS FIRST DEFENSIVE MOVE WILL BE WITH HIS HANDS/ARMS. As such, IT IS PRUDENT TO BEGIN MOST UPPER BODY SUBMISSION ATTACKS WITH A DELIBERATE ATTEMPT TO TAKE OUT YOUR OPPONENTS ABILITY TO USE HIS HANDS DEFENSIVELY PRIOR TO COMPLETING THE SUBMISSION. It’s a simple but important concept - DOMINATE THE HANDS AND YOU WILL USUALLY DOMINATE THE SUBMISSION OVERALL. Don’t get tunnel vision on the submission. Remember that a skilled opponent will resist your attempt as soon as he identifies the danger. Take out the first defensive apparatus he can use and you will be a step ahead as you battle for completion.
