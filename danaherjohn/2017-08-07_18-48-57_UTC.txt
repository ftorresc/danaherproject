Sensei in the training room! My sensei Renzo Gracie has always been my most important guide and influence over the years in jiu jitsu, so it's always a pleasure when he comes in to observe and train with us. Currently the squad is preparing for the tough test of ADCC world championships competition. The specialized tactics make for a harsh training session. Mr Gracie brings so much experience of ADCC style competition and his insights as he watched the young guns prepare was fascinating. Here, the RGA Monday afternoon class relaxes after class with sensei ðŸ˜Š
