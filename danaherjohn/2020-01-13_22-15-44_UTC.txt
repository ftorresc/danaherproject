When you can put a strong mans hand behind his back you make him into a weakling: There is a massive difference between the strength of a man whose hands are in front of him and a mans whose hands have been out behind him. There is a reason why police officers cuff dangerous felons with hands behind the back rather than in front - you should adopt the same policy whenever possible as you grapple. Probably the most well known way to do this is through the Kimura lock. Here, a Gordon Ryan does a great job of getting the hand behind the back into a position where effective defense becomes almost impossible. If the hand is allowed to stay in front, you will have to find ways to incorporate your legs into the move or it will degenerate into a contest of strength. The earlier you get the hand behind the back the better. Your opponent will find it very difficult indeed to recover from such a position as this!
