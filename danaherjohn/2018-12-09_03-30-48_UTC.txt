Big win for Frank Rosenthal in Texas! Junior squad member Frank Rosenthal continued his winning ways tonight at the Onnit Invitational 10 in a super fight against 10th Planet Headquarters stand out Marvin Castille tonight. He used the back system in overtime to strangle his opponent into submission under standard EBI rules and take another great win. Mr Rosenthal has been training very hard and he is a fine example of hard work combined with a plan to get to a goal.
