Alarm clocks and Jiu jitsu: Imagine a friend challenged you to solve a fairly complex math question within a set time. He sat you in a chair, placed some paper and a pen on the table in front of you and set a clock. Just as you begin the challenge the clock emits a loud and continuous alarm sound - perhaps someone else set the alarm earlier in the day. What’s the first step you’d take to solve this math problem? YOU WOULD TURN OFF THE DAMN ALARM!!! It’s very difficult to solve complex problems when distracted. Jiu jitsu is no different. When you go to engage with an opponent it’s always good to begin by SHUTTING DOWN THE OTHER FELLOWS GAME TO THE GREATEST DEGREE POSSIBLE BEFORE IMPOSING YOUR OWN. This means you can focus without the distraction of your opponents attacks whilst doing your thing. Work is always better without distraction - make sure your Jiu jitsu work is also done with the least possible distraction by consciously shutting down your opponents attacking options before trying to impose your own.
