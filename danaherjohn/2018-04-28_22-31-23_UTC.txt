When it comes to fighting, most people think in terms of who is strongest, fastest, most athletic, bravest, toughest etc. These qualities are all very good, but the history of all modes of combat, whether individual or group, shows very clearly that the SMARTEST fighter, the one who employs his resources best and to greatest effect while avoiding harm, is the one who usually prevails. Therefore, make your primary commitment to be THE SMARTEST FIGHTER YOU CAN BE. The one who constantly looks to maximize damage to an opponent whilst minimizing damage to himself. Let THOUGHT be your first reflex when entering confrontation and KNOWLEDGE and SKILL your sword and shield before all other resources.
