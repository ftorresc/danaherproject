Make use of the most distinctive features of Jiu jitsu: There are many distinctive features of Jiu jitsu that separate it from other grappling sports. One that doesnâ€™t get much attention but which is of the greatest importance is that Jiu jitsu, unlike wrestling, judo and sambo, score CHEST TO BACK pins. In judo, only chest to chest pins where you have passed your opponent legs count. In wrestling only pins that touch your opponents back and shoulders to the floor count. Sambo is similar to judo except that they do allow pins when you have not passed an opponents legs in some circumstances. None of them score rear mount as a pin. In Jiu jitsu the rear mount if the highest scoring position (along with front mount). It score twice as much as a takedown or sweep and more than passing guard. Not only is it the biggest scorer in points, it is also the number one position for submitting opponents. In addition it is the safest position in the sport. There is very little an opponent can do offensively from there. As such, Jiu jitsu athletes put a higher value of getting to the rear mount than anything else in the game. It may not score in other grappling sports - but in Jiu jitsu it is the king position. If your goal is excellence in Jiu jitsu then you must make excellence in taking, maintaining and finishing from rear mount as your number one priority.
