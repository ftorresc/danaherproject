Details and direction: Jiu jitsu is absolutely a detail oriented sport. Moves that are performed 90% correctly will fail when used against someone your own level. Adherence to Small details is very often the difference between gold medal and empty hands at the end of a competition. Nonetheless, you must recognize that progress is not only about accumulating details on moves. You must have those details ENCASED IN A GENERAL SENSE OF DIRECTION. You must always have a sense of purpose when you play Jiu jitsu - the details are the means of exhibiting that sense of purpose/direction. In truth you can only remember so many details under stress. Better to have a smaller number of highly relevant details shrouded in a strong sense of direction than endless numbers of details that you can barely remember. For example, in guard passing. A general sense of purpose is conveyed by a principle “seek to create pressure by moving side to side  and favor passing to the side opposite the direction your opponents knees are pointing” and this can give you a broad sense of purpose. Then you can fill in the details of exactly how best to do this with details of grip, body positioning, stance etc etc. So yes - accumulate details over time and do your best to remember them all, but remember that they will serve you much better when they are subsumed under broad guidelines that give you the big picture of what you ought to on the macro level while the details guide you on the micro level
