Perspective from the past: In mid October 1812, Napoleon Bonaparte began his retreat from Moscow in an unusually severe Russian winter. For three months his men endured freezing, deathly temperatures, constant attack, starvation and disorientation all whilst dressed in summer clothing. When his men finally made it back to friendly territory four fifths of them were dead or missing. Whenever I wonder if snow or cold should interrupt training, I think of their story and realize that nothing in our soft comfortable lives will ever approach what they went through and that the things we complain about or use as excuses seem feeble indeed from this perspective. Whether it be Napoleon's retreat, Washington at Valley Forge, the Soviet army in the Battle of Moscow or any other of the myriad examples of humans prevailing in conditions so harsh that one can only feel shame for complaining about our minor problems, this historical perspective keeps us honest in an age where so many look for the weakest excuse to avoid work or training. History teaches us very clearly that we can endure far more we usually tolerate. Snow in NYC? Three champions had no difficulty in getting to the gym to hone their skills. Georges St-Pierre, Jake Shields and Matthew Tesla relax after a session working back attack sequences. Snow day for most? Not for champions...
