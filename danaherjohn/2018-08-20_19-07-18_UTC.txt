The day after: Great to see Kasai 3 @kasaigrappling competitors Wagner Rocha and Marcin Held stop by the blue basement to talk about future projects and catch some technique and training. It’s always impressive how competition often builds camaraderie. At the end of the day we all lead similar lives and have similar goals and dreams. There are far more similarities between athletes, styles and schools than there are differences, so it’s natural that friendships and respect grow easily even between rivals. It was a fine chance for the squad juniors to see elite competitors up close as they work towards their own goals - just as all of you work towards yours - same idea - just a different place and environment.
