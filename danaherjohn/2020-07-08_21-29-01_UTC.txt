Avenues of attack: Things move quickly in combat sports. Opportunities come and go quickly, so when there is an opening one can’t procrastinate. It’s important to have pre-established lines of attack sorted out so that when an opportunity flashes in front of you you know exactly what to do. When working from seated guard against an opponent on their knees, the main avenues of attack will begin at either the wrists, elbows or collar. Each presents very different forms of control and very different lines of attack - make sure you have yours figured out and ready to roll. Here, Gordon Ryan takes on the great Buchecha, a master of hand fighting and posture in guard play. As such he targets the head as the initial connection to base subsequent attacks upon. You must have your own chains of attack starting from each of wrists, elbows and head - when you do, you will be a dangerous opponent from seated guard!
