Working against resistance: Daily drilling of moves is a good thing, but only live sparring will get you proficient in your ultimate goal of being able to control and submit a fully resisting opponent who is trying their best to defeat you. The first line of resistance on the part of your opponent IS THEIR ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE WHAT YOU ARE ATTEMPTING TO DO TO THEM. Only when they make that recognition can they formulate a defense. A huge part of success in combat then, is TO DISGUISE YOUR REAL INTENT UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT. The best attacks typically begin with feints and misdirection that subvert your opponentâ€™s ability to read and recognize your real intent. Once you have gained proficiency in the fundamental movements and skills of the sport - go further AND MAKE MISDIRECTION AND SUBTERFUGE YOUR PRIMARY SKILL. More than anything else, you will need this to break through knowledgeable resistance and bring about the ends you seek.
