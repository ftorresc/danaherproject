Don’t give it away for free (unless you’re setting a trap): The grip fighting that precedes engagement is a subtle art. Too often athletes give free access to good grips to their opponents. If he gets a good grip on you from which to begin the process of control to attack then it should be because he EARNED it - not because you gave it to him. When he goes to control your wrist, pull your wrist away or strip his grip and take your own - don’t just leave wrists out there to be taken and controlled. The only exception to this is when you are setting traps for an opponent and you are using a bait to draw him in. If grip is the first step to control and control is what leads to match winning submission - then make sure he never gets easy grips that lead you into a downward spiral. Be ready deny, block and strip grips because the moment they are established a good opponent will be looking to take them further
