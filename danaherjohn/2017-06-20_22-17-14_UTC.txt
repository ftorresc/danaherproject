California dreaming: Gordon Ryan @gordonlovesjiujitsu is going to California next week for a teaching post. He will be teaching privates and seminars. This is a great chance for our Californian fans to catch up with one of the very best practitioners and teachers off our approach to the sport. Mr Ryan is known primarily as an athlete, but his teaching skills are every bit as good as his competition skills and he does an incredibly good job of showing the moves and tactics he uses with so much success on the big stage. Mr Ryan is a very innovative athlete who constantly looks for more efficient ways to get work done. If you have ever wondered how he gets his moves to work so fluidly against high level opponents, check out his teaching schedule and perhaps he can demystify some elements of his game and make them part of yours. Mr Ryan is a big fan of Southern California and is always trying to get out there as often as possible. The squad always prefers to train people over time rather than "one off" sessions so that we can create progress over time. As often as Mr Ryan travels to California, perhaps you can forge a connection and make training with him a regular thing? Meanwhile the rest of the squad will remain in sweltering, sweaty, smelly Manhattan in preparation for upcoming matches ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’Here, Mr Ryan is coaching his younger brother Nicky Ryan @nickyryanbjj and clearly has done an outstanding job as evidenced by Nicky's recent successes
