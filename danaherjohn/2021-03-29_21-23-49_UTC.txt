Don’t be satisfied with good when great is right there for the taking: Getting into a dominant pin is a good thing but if you want to go the extra distance and progress from position to submission, then you must learn to isolate limbs away from the torso to set up submission entries. Don’t congratulate yourself when you get to your pin - immediately start the task of isolating an arm and head. It will make it tougher for him to escape and easier for you to finish. The earlier you start the task the better your chances of succeeding. Program yourself to WORK from the pin rather than REST from the pin, and you will be a finisher faster than you thought possible
