Counting down: Garry Tonon works through the final week of NYC preparation for his upcoming super fight with the great Shinya Aoki in Singapore on May 26. It will be a fifteen minute grappling match at an MMA event. Next week will be the final steps in contest preparation in Singapore. Mr Tonon had to make full use of his training experience as his main training partners were unavailable. Eddie Cummings had to go to Texas for a match that wound up getting cancelled. Gordon Ryan was badly injured in a freak weightlifting accident at the gym and most of the kohai are overseas. Learning to maximize the value of the partners you have around you is a big part of progress and preparation and Mr Tonon did a good job working through his drills and sparring without his usual partners and working the skills we believe will be important in this great match. Tomorrow will be last day in NYC and then the long journey to the heart of Asia for the big show!
