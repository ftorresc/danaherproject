Weigh in completed in Houston Texas: Gordon Ryan weighed in with the great wrestler, Bo Nickal tonight here in Houston for their hybrid wrestling/Jiu jitsu match tomorrow night. This should be a fascinating encounter as both men are at the top of their respective sports and both have a dynamic and exciting attacking style. Both men will have to wrestle for the takedown (no guard pulling allowed) or at the least, employ a submission attack to take it to the floor. Leg lock finishes are not allowed and both athletes must engage on both floor and ground or risk DQ. Mr Nickal has an extremely impressive and dynamic wrestling game and we were told  has done very well against very good Jiu Jitsu players in training. This should be a great match!! Really interesting and very different from the usual. Now itâ€™s time to do some drills and get ready for the show! Wishing you all the best from Texas!
