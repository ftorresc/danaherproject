The enemy advances, we retreat. The enemy retreats, we pursue: In the ebb and flow of guard play, opponents will sometimes pressure forward and sometimes recede - it’s is crucial you be able to follow that movement to advantage. So often when opponents move back, we stop moving and wait for them to come back to us. This is a missed opportunity. When they disengage it is the perfect time to surge forward and actively come up from bottom position and take your opponent down. Don’t think that because you aren’t a wrestling specialist that this kind of tactic won’t work for you. It’s generally much easier to perform many forms of takedown under these circumstances because your opponents stance is usually compromised. Most Jiu jitsu players are very effective dealing with opponents driving forward into their guard - make sure you are equally effective when they pull away in the opposite direction
