Donâ€™t use triangles because of short legs? Rear triangle (ushiro sankaku) FTW! The triangle has many variations. Unfortunately in Jiu Jitsu most students only really make use of one of the variations - the front triangle - usually performed from guard position. There is no question that the front triangle has proven to be the most applicable and effective in Jiu jitsu competition, but many students tell me it they they are simply too short legged to get the move to work for them in sparring. While there are some ways to maximize your effectiveness with short legs, it is nonetheless quite clear that short legs can be a problem for front triangles. If you want to make use of the incredible power of triangles but feel your leg length is an issue - START USING REAR TRIANGLES. Rear triangles, due to the changes in position and angle, are much easier for short legged athletes to use on broad shouldered opponents than front triangles. Once you start scoring regularly with rear triangles perhaps your confidence will rise and youâ€™ll be more willing to try again with front triangles ðŸ˜Š You never know! Here, Nicky Ryan locks on a flawless rear triangle and shows its incredible power as a restraining hold, arm lock potential and a strangle - itâ€™s an amazing weapon for everyone - including short legged athletes (like me ðŸ˜œ)
