New challenges: The ideal grappler would be one who was equally dominant in both gi and no gi competition, and could even do well in MMA. Obviously such a project is a long term one. Some of the squad members are making first steps in those directions. This weekend, Oliver Taza entered the Canadian Nationals at brown belt and won gold. Here he uses a variation of one of our favorite leg entry set ups, the reverse X guard, to enter into the legs and quickly finish an IBJJF legal knee bar (heel hooks are illegal in this format). It is a nice example of cross over between two different rule sets. Good to see Mr Taza making waves in gi competition while still striving towards his main competition goals
