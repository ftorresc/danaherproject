Getting ready: Neiman Gracie has been training hard for his biggest test yet against one of the greatest welterweights of his generation - Jon Fitch - we are in Connecticut getting ready for the big show with Bellator MMA. Mr Fitch is legendarily tough with a game that shut down the best opponents - but Neiman has world class Jiu jitsu and has shown a great ability to use it effectively in the cage - this will be a great match!
