Moves and movement: Jiu Jitsu is usually taught as MOVES. However, every MOVE presupposes that you are capable of the physical MOVEMENTS that underlie that move. The better your capacity to control and direct the movements of your OWN body, the better will be your ability to perform the moves that will enable you to control and direct the movements of ANOTHER PERSONS body. Therefore, take as much pride and interest in your ability to move yourself around the mat as you do in moving an opponent - your performance of the latter will improve in relation to the former. Whatever your age, physical limitations etc, there is always some way that you can increase or improve your own capacity for movement. Whatever gains you make in this area, no matter how small, will aid you in your quest to perform well the many moves of jiu jitsu and thus move and control another person - the ultimate goal of the sport.
