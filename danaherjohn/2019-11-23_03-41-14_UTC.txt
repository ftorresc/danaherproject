Maximizing connection: Grappling is the business of controlling the movement of a resisting human being who is actively trying to control you as you try to control him. The means of control is PHYSICAL CONNECTION TO AN OPPONENT. Understand that connection comes in DEGREES. You can be more or less connected to an opponent. The more connection - the more control. As such, when itâ€™s time to control a limb to set up a submission, the onus is on you to make sure you maximize the contact and connection between his limb and your body. This will prevent the slippage and space that defeats so many submission attempts. You want focus upon getting the highest possible percentage of the surface area of his limb in contact with you and then to solidify that contact by setting wedges around that limb and using your hands and feet to set those wedges in place. Note how in this photo my hands work at the joints and my head provides supplemental wedging while my feet lock into the opponents legs - maximizing contact and locking it all in place to form a sound connection that will endure long enough even against strong resistance to get the job done
