Attacking the back - Prioritize chest to back connection over the lower body hooks: When you get behind an opponent you SCORE when you hook both your legs into your opponents hips. This tends to create a mindset where most people prioritize the hooks - thatâ€™s natural since they are the means of scoring. In fact you are usually better off prioritizing the chest to back connection locked in place with your arms. AS LONG AS YOU HAVE THIS - YOU CAN ALWAYS GET THE HOOKS LATER. The upper body connection almost always proves more valuable in regaining back position, since most escapes involve getting the upper back to the floor. Solid Chest to back connection makes this extremely difficult and thus nullifies most escapes. Hooks by themselves do little to control an opponents movement and often allow escape. Here, Georges St Pierre has done a good job of retaining solid chest to back connection through his arms and thus can now choose when and how he can follow with his hooks to score and strangle.
