Give a little to gain a lot: Most of the time when you have top position you will be looking to restrict space between you and your opponent and keep a tight chest to chest connection to main your pin. When itâ€™s time to submit opponents however, you can often profit handsomely by giving some space for an opponent to move into. As long as you control which space is made available this will enable you to funnel your opponents movement into whatever trap you have set. The idea of pinning is to PREVENT movement - but the idea of pinning into submission is to DIRECT movement in directions that favor you. Look how Gordon Ryan gives space for an opponent to move into at the chest,  whilst ensuring that the area that really counts - underhook - exhibits no space at all. As such he allows the opponent to maneuver into his own defeat.
