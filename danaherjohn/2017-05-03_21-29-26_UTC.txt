The why versus the how: A big part of my teaching method is to seek as often as possible to explain the "why" of a given move over and above the "how." Usually jiu jitsu is taught in a framework of how to do things. That is fine and absolutely necessary. Without the knowledge of how to perform the various tasks of the sport, there can be no progress. However, I find students react well to being told in addition WHY we do things as we do. Doing so provides a CONTEXT and FRAMEWORK within which techniques can be ordered and understood. This makes it easier for students to recall the information later, and crucially, gives them a clear view of the big picture the instructor is trying to convey. Just a few words at the outset of a training session creates a context for the moves and techniques we will work on and creates a real sense of purpose for the entire training session. Remember moves have not only a TECHNICAL importance, but a TACTICAL importance also. This tactical value is best conveyed by explaining clearly WHY things are done as they are. Getting students to think this way creates students who can be creative and independent, rather than a group of people trained only to follow instructions and who will struggle to create their own game or improvise in sparring. Here, we briefly go over the rationale behind parts of our back defense system - then it's on to the heart of the workout - drilling and sparring!
