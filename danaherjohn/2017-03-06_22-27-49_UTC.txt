LA to NYC: There is always a surreal feeling about going from LA to coach an EBI show Sunday night, then red eye home to New York City to teach at Renzo Gracie Academy Monday morning and then on to The Bronx to teach at night. It's a marathon, but an instructive one. It shows very clearly the two faces of our sport. The core of it will always be the private face of the sport - the unheralded grind in the basement where the skills and attributes necessary for success are forged. The public face is that of competition (shiai), where those hard won skills and attributes can be rewarded with accolades and recognition attained. The glamor is in that public face, but the heart and soul of the sport is in the private face - that's why even though it's tiring, I love that red eye flight home to see the crew and get ready for the next  challenge. Back to the hustle and bustle of freezing cold NYC, subway uptown, then on to the Bronx to work on those skills and attributes ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š @allinphoto @jeffreyschu photos
