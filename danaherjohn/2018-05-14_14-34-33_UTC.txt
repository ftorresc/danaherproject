Big news on Leg lock instructional video - PART 2: Iâ€™ve always preached a commitment to excellence among my students- I wouldnâ€™t be much of a coach if i didnâ€™t follow my own advice. I would have done it this past weekend but I had a prior coaching commitment with Georges St-Pierre. I will also add new material not shown in first video and seek to improve my delivery of information to make a leaner and better viewing  experience and help atone for the initial problem.  Never having shot a video before I just assumed the production company would be the experts to trust with the technical matters while i did the coaching- Iâ€™m not sure what went wrong as even a simple phone camera takes better audio than some of the scenes on the instructional. I am greatly heartened by the many messages i have received from people who loved the content of the video and are seeing improvements in both their performance and understanding - now I hope to do even better by bringing production up to the same level ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤— Apologies to you all for the initial mishap and looking forward to setting it straight this weekend!
