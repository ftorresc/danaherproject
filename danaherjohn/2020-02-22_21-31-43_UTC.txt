Squad rampage: The squad went hunting for medals last night in Florida at Sub Stars grappling event. Ethan Crelinsten fought above his weight class against Enrico Cocco and came out victorious. Nicky Ryan took on MMA champion JZ Calvacante and winter with a devastating heel hook. Nicky Rod took on black belt Roosevelt Sousa and won via strangle. In the main event Gordon Ryan took on Tex Johnson and won easily with a stranglehold kata gatame. Victory over high level opponents is not the only goal of Jiu Jitsu, not the deepest goal - but it certainly is a good sign that your training program is going in the right directions. Hope you all enjoyed the show - thanks also to Garry Tonon doing a fine job cornering fellow athletes to victory when he could not compete himself due to suffering a cut in training a few days before the event.
