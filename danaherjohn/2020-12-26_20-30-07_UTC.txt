You always start directly in front of opponents - but your goal is always to move from there to an advantageous angle in order to attack: Every match starts with the two athletes squared off in front of each other, but the easiest attacks are those where you have an angle out to the side, or best of all, behind your opponent. As such, the general pattern of all your training ought to be an initial square off followed by constant jousting for angle. If you can’t get angle you will have to find another form of advantage (eg level). Try not to settle for attacking straight through the front door (unless it’s a distraction or ruse for a second attack). You can get away with it when you are bigger,stronger, faster or in better shape - but when you face athlete of equal prowess to yourself, that will be an unsuccessful strategy in the vast majority of cases. Start asking yourself what your favorite means of gaining angle out of frontal positions are. Try to find other methods that compliment your favorites. Be sure to be able to get angles on BOTH SIDES as the more an opponent resists on one side, the easier it will be to get to the other. Remember always that just because you START in front of your opponent, that doesn’t mean you want to STAY in front - constantly joust for angles and if you get them, your attacks will double their effectiveness. If you don’t, your opponent will have to work so hard to main square positioning he will be easier to attack by other means
