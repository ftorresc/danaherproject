Damn! That was close! Once again my astounding skills to be late for everything - especially airline travel - come to the fore. Barely made flight to Finland despite catastrophic traffic, apparently due to presence of our President in NYC between Renzo Gracie Academy and the airport. God bless the ladies at check in desk and security who felt sorry for me and rushed me through! ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡Looking forward to seeing the squad and our Finnish friends and of course, the elite of our sport at ADCC. Can't wait to meet up with my dear sensei, Renzo Gracie when he arrives. Mind racing with multiple projects - ADCC, Georges St-Pierre returning to UFC, upcoming EBI's including a slap grappling edition featuring Garry Tonon - should be an interesting time! Wishing you all the best! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
