Young guns: Tomorrow squad kohai (apprentices) will go out to compete at Global Grappling League. Fifteen year old Nicky Ryan @nickyryanbjj  will take on twenty five year old Marvin Castelle, an instructor at 10th Planet's main school. Ethan Crelinsten @ethancrelinsten will take on JM Holland another 10th Planet standout. In addition, other kohai will compete in what should be a great local tournament for the youngsters to get valuable experience and exposure on the growing submission only circuit. Seniors Garry Tonon @garrytonon and Gordon Ryan @gordonlovesjiujitsu will corner their understudies and give them the guidance that saw them through to so much success and which the youngsters strive to emulate. It's been a great week of training for the kohai and all are excited to put their skills to test on the stage. Wonderful to see them getting used to the idea of specialized preparation and planning to get to a goal and showing the discipline and fortitude to go in well prepared and ready for action.
