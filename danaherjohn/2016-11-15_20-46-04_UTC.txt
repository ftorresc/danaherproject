EBI 10 coming soon: Eddie Cummings has been training very hard for EBI 10 at a new weight of 135 pounds. He has been adding new attacks to his already extremely dangerous repertoire and is looking to put on a another great performance under the lights. This time the event will be in Mexico City. As part of the trip I shall teach a seminar on some of the elements that have allowed our team to do so well at previous shows. It will be hosted by my old team mate Mario Delgado Davila, who has a very successful school in Mexico City. I will be my first trip to Mexico, so I am very much looking forward to seeing the land, the city and the jiu jitsu of this great country. I hope to be able to help in some small way the development of the game in the ways that the squad is known for ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
