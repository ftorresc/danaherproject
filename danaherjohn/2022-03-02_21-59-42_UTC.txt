Space: Whenever you play bottom position in Jiu jitsu a fundamental requirement for you to be effective is enough space between you and your opponent for you to be able to move freely into your techniques. You seek a middle ground. Too much space and you won’t be close enough to actually apply techniques. Too little space and you won’t have adequate room in which to move to get into your techniques. A good rule of thumb is that if you have space to bring one knee and elbow close together under an opponent while still maintaining contact - you have enough space to move and enough proximity to be effective. This state of affairs won’t last long - a good top opponent will always seek to rob you of space - so once once you’ve created space it’s time to get to work!
