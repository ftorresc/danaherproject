The great theme of Georges St Pierre’s career - preparation supersedes everything: Fighting and competition can be a scary thing. It’s natural to think of it  interns of how it appears to an audience - as a battle between two athletes on a competitive stage where the man or woman who shines best on the night takes victory - but the great theme pushed by arguably the greatest MMA athlete of all time is that the athletes PREPARATION is more important than any factors on the night of the bout. As such, the entire focus of Mr St Pierre’s career was in progressive skill development over the year and meticulous preparation in specialized fight camps for a given opponent whenever a bout contract was signed. Understand this - NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE OUTCOME OF A GIVEN BOUT IS DETERMINED BEFORE THE ATHLETES STEP IN THE CAGE OR ON THE MAT. What transpires on the stage is just a reflection of their relative depth of preparation prior to the match. Don’t focus on giving your heart and soul on the stage - FOCUS ON GIVING YOUR HEART AND SOUL IN THE PREPARATION LEADING UP TO YOU STEPPING ON TO THE STAGE - and then the bout will take care of itself.
