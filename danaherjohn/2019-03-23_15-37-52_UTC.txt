Tokyo bound with the the Lion Killer: heading to @onechampionship Tokyo with @garrytonon at Newark Airport. He has trained exceedingly well as always - so impressive with his drive to learn and improve - a real inspiration to all the other athletes in the room. Thank you all so much for your interest in our approach to the game. Will try to keep you all updated as the week progresses. I will miss all my students in the basement as always but excited to see you all when I get back! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
