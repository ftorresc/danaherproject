Angle: The human body is set up very well to defend attacks coming from directly in front and very poorly adapted to deal with attacks directly from the rear. As a result, opponents will do everything they can to prevent you getting the preferred rear positions. A good substitute when you can’t get directly behind an opponent, but still don’t want the difficulty of direct frontal attacks, is ANGLE. getting to an angle on an opponent gets away from strong frontal defenses and is a lot easier to get to than all the way behind. In the case of most submissions entry from bottom position you will need some degree of angle on your opponent to get a good entry and a sting mechanical finish. Here, Gordon Ryan  does a fine job of going perpendicular to an opponent from underneath and as a result, enters easily into a strong leg attack. Don’t fight your way in from the front when you can halve your difficulty by entering in from the side. Take the take to find angle first and attack second. You will get twice the success with half the effort.
