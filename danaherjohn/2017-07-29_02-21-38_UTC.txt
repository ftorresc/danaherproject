New York always has a surprise in store: So here I am in a shockingly empty JFK departure lounge, doing some writing and reading and plotting to burn the three hour delay in my plane departure, when alongside me sits a fellow I have not seen in thirty years! And that was on TV! When I was in college in New Zealand, I was an avid weight lifter and many of my gym partners were part of the small Pro Wrestling circuit in New Zealand. They took their inspiration from American pro wrestling, especially the WWE (I believe it was WWF in those days) one of their favorites was a bad guy character called Virgil, who was the sinister accomplice of Ted Dibiase, the Million dollar man. Their schtick was money money money (you hear that Gordon Ryan?). Money rules all. Here I am sitting in JFK and out of nowhere Virgil sits next to me (I know, no one under the age of thirty five knows who he was but there have to be some old cronies out there that remember ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚). It turns out he is a huge UFC fan and loves Anderson Silva - I have to explain that I coached Chris Weidman to defeat Mr Silva - oops! He is a great character and apparently doing very well. It's making me think about the links between pro wrestling and MMA. Sometimes the link can be destructive, but sometimes it works well - look at Sakuraba. Chael Sonnen masterfully used pro wrestling antics to build a great career. Ha ha!! NYC is crazy - you never know who you will run into, even on a boring wait in an empty airport lounge! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
