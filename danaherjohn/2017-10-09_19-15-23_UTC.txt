Tough training in Montreal: Great grappling workout here in Montreal, Canada with MMA icon, Georges St-Pierre asssisted by UFC veteran Frances Carmont and squad members Garry Tonon and Jake Shields. Creating a sound training structure for the grappling component of the camp over the final three weeks is the priority- got a strong start today and more for the future. Running over some interesting thoughts for running Mr Tonon’s EBI camp alongside Mr St-Pierre’s camp - would require some logistics and planning- will run it by sensei and see what we can do in these three weeks. Big hello to all my faithful and long suffering students back in the basement - and wishing all the squad/RGA fans well from Montreal.
