The squad had a blast today training with the great Keenan Cornelius. Mr Cornelius has always been one of our strongest rivals - a true innovator and pioneer in the sport and someone we have always admired. He had some great rounds with the juniors as we all went through standing and ground grappling. He is an athlete whose game changes very dramatically from gi to no gi so it was fascinating to watch his no gi game and how it contrasts with our own. Looking forward to more sessions over the week from this outstanding American grappler.
