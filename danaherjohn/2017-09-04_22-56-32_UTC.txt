The tale of the army of darkness: one time after an EBI show, if I remember it correctly it was an EBI that Eddie Cummings won, the squad was relaxing after a good nights work backstage at the Orpheum theater in Los Angeles where the event was held. Mr Cummings, Tonon and Ryan were doing interviews joined by Ottavia Bourdain, I went outside to reflect on the nights work and ponder over where improvements could be made. As I stood outside a rather strange looking Californian fellow who looked like a genetic splicing of Nicholas Cage and the bad guy from the 80's classic Stallone movie "Cobra" approached me. He stood silently in front of me, staring with an intense gaze. Finally he addressed me in a gravelly voice. "DANAHER...I watched the show...leg locks...everywhere...leg locks...no escape...I see what you've done." Rather taken aback by his dramatic opening, I answered, "Thank you, sir...ah...what actually have I done?" The stranger stared at me awhile and then answered, "your students...Cummings, Tonon, Ryan...very impressive...I see what you've done..." Again I replied, "ah...what do you think I've done." The rather ominous nature of the conversation continued. "I see the way you walk...the way you move...your hip...your knee...you're in PAIN...I see what you've done..." Rather intrigued by this strange dialogue I said back, "I'm sorry sir, I don't really follow you, I'm not really sure what you think I've done." He immediately replied, "You've raised an ARMY OF DARKNESS. They travel around breaking everybody's legs - so that everyone else feels the same pain you feel - THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE DONE!!" And with that dramatic statement the stranger wheeled around and shuffled off into the shadows of central Los Angeles.
