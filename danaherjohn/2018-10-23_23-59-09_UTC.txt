The single greatest attribute that a coach can build in a student is SELF RELIANCE. You can have a great team behind you, the best coaches, legions of fans, sponsors , whatever you care to name - but at the end of the day the athlete walks on to the stage ALONE. He will be tested alone and his ability to trust in himself, develop himself, motivate himself and assess himself will be what determines success or failure on the big stage.
