Excited for upcoming seminars! I am always happy to get chances to teach outside the blue basement when scheduling permits. In January and February I will teach for the first time in Utah and Texas! First up is Utah, where on January 18 at Unified Jiu Jitsu in South Jordan. Check out @utahjitsmama to get information and tickets for Utah seminar. Then in Texas on February 3rd I will team up with Gordon Ryan to teach a big seminar at Gracie One in Dallas. Mr Ryan is super excited to show some of his own latest developments - i am always greatly impressed by the innovations of my students and Mr Ryan has been on a research mission lately - always adding new and deadly attacks to his arsenal. Check out @gracieonejiujitsu for information and booking for Dallas, Texas seminar. Itâ€™s always a pleasure to show our style to new friends - looking forward to both these events ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤— See you there!!
