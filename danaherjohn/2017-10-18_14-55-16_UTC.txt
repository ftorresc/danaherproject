Young guns running amok: Squad apprentices (kohai) @jasonraubjj89 @nick.ronan and @frankrosenthal11 dominated the action last weekend while we were away training Mr St-Pierre and Mr Tonon. The Rise grappling event featured east coast talent - at the center of the action was Matt Serra BJJ and RGA. Two of Mr Serra’s students train regularly with us in the basement. Jason Rau won his superfight via heel hook submission, Nick Ronan had an outstanding performance using our back and front headlock systems to strangle four opponents back to back and take gold in the main tournament and Frank Rosenthal won a superfight via submission in short order. Great to see these talented young athletes going out and developing their resume and their brands - and doing it in the best way possible - convincing victory out on the local stage with an eye for bigger wins ahead - a fine example to all those among you looking to build your name in the sport.  A big hello to our brothers out on the island at serrabjj - same lineage - working together. Mr Serra was always an inspiration to me and it’s a pleasure to help the progression of his students in any way. Back in NYC now! Heading to the basement to see how everyone is doing and get our training back on - then off to LA and return to Montreal to get Mr Tonon and Mr St-Pierre ready for action!
