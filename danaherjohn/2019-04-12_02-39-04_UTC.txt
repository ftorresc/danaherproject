Big plans: Here I am with my great friends @bernardofariabjj and @michaelzenga from @bjj.fanatics We are discussing our biggest video project yet - the follow up to the ENTER THE SYSTEM instructional series - it will focus on BJJ Fundamentals and as the name GO FURTHER FASTER implies, will cover a systematic approach to getting to a higher level in less time in Jiu Jitsu. We had a great day filming in the blue basement - now we are discussing video ideas in downtown Manhattan. My goal is to change the nature of video instruction and make it a viable addition to your learning journey that does not merely offer some moves to mimic, but rather changes your thinking and perception of the sport and pushes you towards creative independence and self discovery. Canâ€™t wait to tackle this project! Wishing you all the best from NYC! #knowmore/winmore
