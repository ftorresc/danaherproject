One move - with many faces: One of the central demands jiu jitsu makes of us is to adapt the various techniques of the sport to the limitless and rapidly changing circumstances in which we may have to apply them. Accordingly, any given technique will often have many variations that allow it to cover a vast number of contingencies. This is why at the higher levels, I often am reluctant to say someone is doing something incorrectly (though I am usually not reluctant at all to say something is wrong at beginner levels ðŸ˜œ). Very often good athletes can discern a different means of performing a technique THAT STAYS TRUE TO THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES OF THAT TECHNIQUE (and thus remains effective), BUT INVOLVES SOME UNORTHODOX ELEMENTS THAT MAKE IT APPEAR "INCORRECT." This is a good thing, for it allows for adaptation to the actual circumstances, rather than an artificial adherence to correct form that may not apply in that particular circumstance. Here, standout apprentice (kohai) student, Oliver Taza, takes gold at the IBJJF New York open with a juji gatame arm lock from his opponents back, but changes into an unorthodox leg positioning to better cover the angle and positioning of his opponents body during the transition and subsequent defensive movements. Despite the cosmetic changes, THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES OF THE MOVE ARE RETAINED - AND THAT IS WHAT IS IMPORTANT FOR VICTORY.
