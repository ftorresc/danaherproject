Countdown in Texas: The squad is in Austin Texas getting ready for the big WHO’S NUMBER ONE grappling show tomorrow night. Gordon Ryan will take on one the squads biggest rivals, Vagner Rocha. Both athletes have met before but in a lighter weight category and both have changed a lot since their last meeting. Nicky Rod is back on stage. He will take on the great ADCC champion Yuri Simoes. Mr Simoes is one of only three athletes ever to win ADCC gold in two different weight categories. Both have a high energy takedown focus game and neither likes to give an inch of ground - this one should be a great match! Oliver Taza will take on Johnny Tama in another exciting match up. Today was weigh in with all athletes close to each other in weight to make for a great show tomorrow! Now it’s training time and then tomorrow the big show!!
