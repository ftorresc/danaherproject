The spine/head is the longest lever in the human body - use it from bottom position: The first guard you learn in Jiu jitsu is usually closed guard. Often i think this common practice is an error - Closed guard probably should not be the first guard you learn - itâ€™s actually a very specialized position that does not always come smoothly from the pin escapes that students learn first in jitsu. I often think half guard and variations of open guard may be better  guards for beginning students to learn first. Nonetheless closed guard is an extremely important guard to learn whether you learn it first or last or somewhere in between. Understand immediately that there is going to be a contest between you and your opponent for posture. You want to break him forward - he wants to stay upright and away. It will come down to the pull of your legs and stomach versus the pull up and away of his back and head. Who wins? As always - THE ONE WHO USES THE LEVER TO ADVANTAGE. Your opponents spine is a long lever. If the lock of your closed guard is low - at the base of the lever - your pull will be weak and unlikely to break a good opponents posture. If you shift the lock of your feet higher - up to the head and shoulders - you are operating at the end of the lever and your pulling force will be considerable. When you want to pull - get your feet and legs up high on the back. Much of your success with arm bars, triangles and omoplatas will come out of your ability to switch to a high lock from closed guard - practice it constantly until it is natural and easy for you.
