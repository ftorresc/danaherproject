On the road again: This weekend in Honolulu, Garry Tonon takes on the great ADCC Champion Davi Ramos in Fight 2 Win grappling event. I am at JFK getting ready to fly out as we prepare for the big show this weekend. Lots of very interesting shows coming up as Gordon Ryan prepares to take on the great wrestling champion Bo Nickel in around two weeks and Nicky Rod takes in MMA great (and very talented grappler) Luke Rockhold. Keep an eye on these great match ups! Wishing you all the best from JFK Airport - keep learning - keep training - make every day an opportunity to get a little closer to your Jiu Jitsu goals!
