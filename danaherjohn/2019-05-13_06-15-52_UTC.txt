Amazing first day here is Singapore at @evolvemma super seminar with @garrytonon @gordonlovesjiujitsu and @nickyryanbjj The theme of the camp is the crucial interface between offense and defense in Jiu Jitsu. Garry Tonon got everyone off to an incredible start with his signature escape into offense skills. Now itâ€™s big Gordon Ryan up next to teach our approach to closed guard the way we like it - as a devastating attack position that with the right methods, can get you dominance from underneath an adversary. In the future Garry and Gordon will produce videos on these subjects so itâ€™s amazing to see the depth of their instruction and their own innovative ways of presenting the material ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ Things are about to start up now!!
