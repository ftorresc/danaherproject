Remember - in Jiu jitsu it’s not how much you’ve learned that counts - it’s HOW MUCH CAN YOU RECALL AND PERFORM UNDER STRESS that counts. As such don’t put your emphasis on AMOUNT of information but rather upon SUMMARY of information. Better to know the two most pertinent details for a given scenario than twenty of lesser importance. Constantly look for ways to filter all the information you receive into summaries that work for you as an individual to recall under pressure. As a teacher I can give a mountain of details but you must actively seek to focus on the ones that are most important for improving your individual performance.
