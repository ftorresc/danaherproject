From open guard on a standing opponent: Dominate the head and dominate the space between his elbows - and victory will be yours. Whenever you have a standing opponent in your opponent guard, your first goals is always to BREAK HIS POSTURE/BALANCE. One of the best ways to do this is through the use of the cross lapel grip and the use of a foot on the bicep that dominates the inside position between his elbows. If you can keep his head lower than his waist and his elbow behind his shoulder - he wonâ€™t be able to threaten you with passing but you will be able to threaten him with any sweep or submission of your choice. So when you go to tie up from open guard - dominate the head and dominate the inside position at the elbow - your success rate will immediately rise ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ
