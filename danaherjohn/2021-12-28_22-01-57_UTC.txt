Know what you want - make a flexible plan to get there: People who know what they want usually get there. Those who know what they want and have a good plan to navigate their way get there get there often. Those who know what they want and have a flexible plan that adjusts to the many variables and contingencies that life throws at us over time almost always get there. Those that have no idea what they want have to be content with whatever fate gives them - sometimes good, sometimes bad, but never an expression of your will. Your work outs must reflect this pattern. If you come in with no goal and no plan, the worth of your workout will be determined by those around you, sometimes good, sometimes bad, never an expression of a vision you have of yourself as a better player in the future, but only a vague hope that one day maybe youâ€™ll be good. If you come in with a clear goal and a plan to enact it that can change intelligently according to changing circumstances over time you will find over time that goals get realized and the you of today beats the you of yesterday, just as the you of tomorrow will defeat the you of today. You carry a lot into every workout - your physicality, tactics, technique, enthusiasm, passion, worries, anxieties, fatigue, injuries, burn out - but the most important thing you can ever bring is A GOAL AND A PLAN
