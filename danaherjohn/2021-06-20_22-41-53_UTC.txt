Getting the band back together! Georges St Pierre is here for grappling training here in Puerto Rico. Itâ€™s always great seeing old friends - even when they come to kick your ass! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ The squad has a big grappling event coming up next month so itâ€™s training time! Tonight we relax before training tomorrow. Great to be back by the ocean after coming back from Texas!
