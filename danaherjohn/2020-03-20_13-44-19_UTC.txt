The biggest sale in BJJ Fanatics history!! The company I make instructional videos for @bjj.fanatics is having their biggest sale in the history of the company today through next week in response to the corona virus situation. Company directors Bernardo Faria and a Michael Zenga told me that there has been a great demand for video instruction during this time where regular training has been curtailed for most of us. They have just created a sale that is bigger even than the Black Friday sale! 42% off all my and the other instructors videos across the store! This one came out of nowhere as usually Black Friday is the biggest sale of the year but special times require special responses - sounds like a great idea to me! If you are interested check out the sale and build your knowledge!!!
