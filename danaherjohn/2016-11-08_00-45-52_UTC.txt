It's a celebration bitches! NYC style: Actually no, the squad never celebrates victories. Tomorrow it's back to the basement of suffering to refine and develop skills for the squad. The ADCC trials are around the corner, Eddie Cummings must step up to face the challenge of EBI 10 at a new weight of 135 pounds - against the man we consider the best of Eddie Bravo's students - Geo Martinez. He is very interesting as an opponent because he is one of the few remaining 10th planet athletes who is really skilled in the true 10th planet system based around rubber guard/ lockdown half guard/twister rather than the modern 10th planet athletes style which is basically cloned after our  own style. Mr Cummings  preparation so far has been superb, but his aspirations are even higher. Then Gordon and Nicky Ryan face big superfight challenges in San Diego - so it's back to training and development for the squad - time to turn off the disco lights and crank up the ashi garamis ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Awesome photo by Jeff Chu
