I started my career teaching introductory classes to one or two white belts at a time. Then I built up to small beginner classes with five or six people. In time I averaged over a hundred people per class in the lunch hour with some of the greatest combat athletes in the world. Now I’ve come full circle and I’m back to teaching tiny classes. I was able to create a sense of progress and development in all cases regardless of class size, location or talent level. Your rate of progress towards your goals has much more to do with what is inside your head than where you are, who is around you or how many people there are. Know what you want - acquire the skills to make it possible - formulate a plan to get there - have the discipline to stay the course and the wisdom to modify the plan in the face of changing circumstances and you can shock the world regardless of where you are and who or how many you are surrounded by.
