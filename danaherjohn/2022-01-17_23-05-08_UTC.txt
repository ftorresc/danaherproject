What’s the hurry? Submission holds all have their own character. Sometimes speed of application really does help get the breakthrough. Other times a submission hold can be a long process of control and switching from one position, grip or even a different submission altogether. As a general rule - submissions where you position an opponent on their back or butt tend to be the slower paced submissions where it’s wise to emphasize control first and submission second; whilst submissions performed is rolling on to hands and knees with chest down to floor are usually best performed at a quicker pace - though there are exceptions. The most important thing is this - LEARN TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THOSE SUBMISSIONS THAT OPERATE BEST WITH HIGH PACE EXECUTION AND THISE WITH LOW PACE EXECUTION AND PERFORM THEM AT THE SPEED APPROPRIATE TO THE SITUATION. Understand that pace of execution is an important factor in the success or failure of most submissions and that mixing up speed versus control usually has bad consequences. When slow and steady is appropriate - go slow and steady. When fast and aggressive is appropriate - go in fast and aggressive. PACE is one of the least talked about factors in the application of submission holds but one of the most important for good results. You’ll need to be able to go both fast and slow - and crucially, recognize when you use one and when to use the other
