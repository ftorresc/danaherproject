Exciting news from Garry Tonon! This Friday @garrytonon and @bjj.fanatics will release Mr Tonon’s first instructional video EXIT THE SYSTEM. This will cover one of the most important elements of Jiu Jitsu - escape - in particular the link between submission holds and escapes. One of the most distinctive features of my coaching program is the heavy emphasis on escape skills. Only when you believe in your power to escape will commit fully to your attacks and hold nothing back. There is a reason why Garry Tonon is the most exciting grappler in the world - it’s because he has no fear of being held down and controlled. As a result he can take risks that would make anyone else hesitate. All of my senior students bare innovators who develop their own moves and variations that gives them a strong personal interpretation of my program. You can benefit enormously by learning escape skills from one of the absolute best escape artists in the world. Learn the crucial interface between defense and offense and watch your confidence on the mat rise as never before. My students are all truly excellent teachers - I teach them to teach as well as they compete - you will see this in the video. Georges St-Pierre nick named Garry Tonon “The slippery salmon” for a reason - he is almost impossible to pin down and control - learn his secrets and soon you will be too! 😜😜Get ready for the big launch Friday @bjj.fanatics
