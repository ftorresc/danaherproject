Rise among your peers: 90% of your training and development is done among your peers within your own dojo. As a result, your whole image of yourself is built upon your relative successes and failures among your peers. Your attempts to gauge your progress is largely done by assessing how much better or worse you are doing with them. They are your best friends and fiercest rivals, your measuring stick for who you were, who you are now and who you want to be in the future. Dream big - far beyond the walls of your dojo - but understand that it is your peers and your drive to rise among them that will be the vast majority of your Jiu Jitsu life. So dream big and international but realize that your daily life will always be familial and local - train accordingly.
