Craig Jones and Oliver Taza getting ready for their big matches tomorrow night in Austin Texas: Another big show in Austin tomorrow for Whoâ€™s Number One and @flograppling Craig Jones will take on the extraordinarily talented Tye Ruotolo one of the very best from the outstanding ATOS team. This will be a classic match up of ATOS athletic movement and physical conditioning against the slower more control based squad style. Oliver Taza will take on the brilliant Brazilian prodigy Mica Galvao. Mr Galvao shares a common factor with Mr Ruotolo - he was literally born into Jiu jitsu. Both have practiced at extremely high level since childhood and so bring a level of knowledge and skill to the game far beyond their years. Amazing work again by the promotion to bring such talented athletes out the stage! Craig and Oliver have trained hard as always but they will be very severely tested by such tough and talented opponents! Keep your eyes on this show tomorrow night!
