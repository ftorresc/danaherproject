Defending what's yours: Garry Tonon defeated the very tough Dustin Akbari to win the Fight To Win welterweight belt. Now he must defend it against three time world championship ADCC veteran Justin Rader. Mr Rader has built a fine grappling career around excellent wrestling, superb Submission defense, a very nasty guillotine and great tactical sense.  Mr Tonon will have to travel to Mr Rader's home territory in Oklahoma City to defend his title. Friday night the two American standouts will clash in a ten minute submission only match. Should it go the distance, a decision based on control and submission attempts will be made. Mr Tonon has trained with his usual enthusiasm and completeness. Recent improvements in his positional game, particularly in the subtleties of limb positioning, are something I look forward to seeing in his upcoming matches. Looking forward to overseeing these last few days of training and then the big show Friday night. Fight to Win continues to impress with great shows and excellent match ups - this match between two great American welterweights in the American heartland should be a real show! Fight to Win 28
