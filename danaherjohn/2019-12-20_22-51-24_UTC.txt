If you can get both your opponents feet to leave the mat - he will be very hard pressed indeed to stop you scoring: Tomoe nage is not only a wonderful throw from standing position when using the gi, it is a truly superb sweep from open guard as well. Due to the fact that it fully uses the vast strength potential of the legs, it is truly one of the best moves to use against heavier, stronger opponents. The main thing is to break the opponents balance forward and get him up on his toes. The good news is that there are many forms of open guard that make this possible. Here I am using lasso guard to get the man up in his toes and in position to be swept overhead. Every Jiu Jitsu player needs a strong Tomoe nage attack both on the feet and on the floor. Some moves drift in and out of style - but Tomoe nage will always be among the main weapons of a ground grappler ðŸ˜œðŸ˜Š
