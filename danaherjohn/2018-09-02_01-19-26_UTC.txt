Leg locks in the desert: Had a wonderful day teaching at RGA Reno - the new dojo of Max McGarr - an outstanding teacher at RGA New York for many years. He is spreading our methodology out here and doing a fine job!! Itâ€™s great to see that as i travel and teach around the nation the overall level of competence in lower body submissions that i witness in seminars is definitely increasing - you guys and gals are studying hard and getting better! ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ Happy to see! Tomorrow I head back to the blue basement for another week of training with the squad - lots of goals, lots of ambition and consequently- lots of work to be done ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ Hope you have a great Labor Weekend!
