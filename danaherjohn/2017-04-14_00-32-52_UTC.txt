The return of the wolverine: tomorrow night in Philadelphia, Eddie Cummings returns to center stage to take on three time world champion Samir Chantre - himself a master of leg locking via figure four toe hold, in what should be a great encounter. The rules of fight to Win events are a ten minute match without points, if it goes the distance, the athlete demonstrating greater submission potential (where submissions are understood as a viable threat that forces a serious defensive reaction) and/or positional control will take a decision victory. Mr Cummings has prepared very thoroughly as always and has many new elements to his game, many of which are his own invention and extremely impressive. Can't wait to see these two great champions clash!
