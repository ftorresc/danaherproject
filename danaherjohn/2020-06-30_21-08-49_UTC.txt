Want to make faster decisions? Limit your options: One of the most important factors in who wins and who loses in a Jiu jitsu match is SPEED AND QUALITY OF DECISION MAKING. Athletes who make good decisions quickly generally beat athletes who make good decisions slowly. One simple and effective way to increase your speed of decision making is to LIMIT YOUR OPTIONS PER SCENARIO. If you have a thousand options you will inevitably slow down as you decide between competing option. Have one or two strong attacks per scenario and the decision making process becomes very easy and very fast. Of course itâ€™s no good to make BAD decisions quickly - they have to be good ones. To accomplish this I suggest researching the most HIGH PERCENTAGE moves in modern competition in a range of scenarios. If you have a small set of well trained high percentage moves in each of the main scenarios we regularly find ourselves in daily sparring, you will immediately notice decision making is faster and more decisive - and that will result in the fast and decisive action - a key element of winning Jiu jitsu
