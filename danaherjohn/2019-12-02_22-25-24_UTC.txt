Protect your position first, but keep your eyes open for the possibility of submission at all times: We humans are prone to tunnel vision, particularly in stressful situations. Very often we get to a good position and remember our mantra to protect the position first and everything else second and as a result, we blind ourselves to great opportunities to enter a submission hold that were there right in front of us. Look at this photo of Gordon Ryan - master of back attacks - attacking from his favorite position. His body has contoured perfectly to his opponents, forming a tight connection and his head and hip position will enable him to easily follow an opponents movement. However, notice that his eyes are focused entirely on the neck - the target of submission. So though his body is set upon maintaining position, his mind is set upon submission - indeed, he has unlocked his hands already to take advantage of the open neck he is looking so intently at and a few seconds later he will be locking in a powerful strangle. Condition yourself to think the same way. Let your body protect the position, but keep your mind focused like a laser on the next step - submission!
