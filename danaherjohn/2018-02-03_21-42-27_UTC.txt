Jumping in: Squad junior Ethan Crelinsten walks around at one hundred and forty pounds. Two days ago he heard a local professional grappling tournament Show The Art Invitational, was having a big tournament at 170 pounds and needed an athlete. He immediately jumped in despite the size difference and today he won the whole event in brilliant fashion - winning all four matches via submission in regulation time (EBI) rules. Here he is relaxing after the show, counting his shekels and plotting his next move ðŸ˜œ Sometimes a spontaneous test like this can do wonders for an athletes confidence.
