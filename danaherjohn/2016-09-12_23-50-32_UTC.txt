The day after: Immediately after winning EBI 8 Gordon Ryan completes a tough training session with team mates Garry Tonon and Nicky Ryan at my good friend Shawn Williams gym in LA. We worked in preparation for Mr Tonon's match in Florida this weekend. It is impressive to see an athlete coming back to train hard the day after victory to help his team mate and it gives a good sense of why these great friends have experienced so much success. Unfortunately I won't be there for the last few days of training as I shall be headed to Australia tonight ðŸ˜ž but we got a clear sense of direction worked out in the last two weeks and we will communicate across the pacific to finalize plans. Mr Ryan will be there to corner and support Mr Tonon ðŸ˜Š Always sad to leave LA - it is a city I have always been fascinated by and always enjoyed my time - sometimes I think about teaching here, I am sure it would be fun ðŸ˜Š@shawnwilliamsbjj
