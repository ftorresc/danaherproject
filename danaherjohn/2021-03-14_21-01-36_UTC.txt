Opening gambits: Jiu jitsu is a game with a lot of chaos built into it that prevents us from ever fully knowing what will happen or what the best options are - nonetheless when you first go to engage with an opponent there are only so many opening moves. This is one area where you can go into a match with a pretty good idea of what will unfold based on initial movements. Make sure you have at least a few favorite options to come out with a plan rather than just come out and see what happens. Iâ€™m sure many of you will recognize the opening gambit shown here by a Craig Jones - a squad favorite and perfect for anyone looking to get off to ta strong start via leg locking.
