Last training day in NYC: Last training day for the squad. As always, the idea is to take the athlete to a peak on the night of the big show. That means a juggling of conflicting demands and priorities that makes for an interesting last week. In this case it was particularly interesting as the two athletes involved have very different opponents in a completely different rule set and are themselves very different individuals. Here Eddie Cummings and I fervently discuss possible scenarios and problems whilst the supremely confident Garry Tonon looks on in bemusement at our folly.
