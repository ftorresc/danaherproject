If you can make an opponent involuntarily put his hands to the mat to recover balance from open guard - you can make magic happen. If not, everything you try will be a fight. Remember, if his hands are on the mat - they aren’t on you - and if they aren’t on you, he can’t pass your guard and he is open to whatever attacks you initiate. SO GET THOSE HANDS TO THE MAT WHENEVER YOU CAN - a whole world of offense that was previously denied to you will soon open up!
