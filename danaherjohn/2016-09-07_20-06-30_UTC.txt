Welcome to Australia: Immediately after EBI 8 where Gordon Ryan squares off against a very talented array of potential opponents in a new weight class of 185 pounds, I shall head down to Australia to catch up with family for the first time since my hip replacement ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜Š Whilst down there I shall observe the friendly local wildlife ğŸ˜°ğŸ˜³ğŸ¤•ğŸ˜–ğŸ˜±ğŸ’€ğŸ˜‰ So far the main topics for seminars in Sydney and Melbourne are "No gi butterfly guard vs saltwater crocodile attack," "Spider guard vs great white shark" and "half guard sweeps vs combined taipan snake and box jellyfish attack." Should be interesting...
