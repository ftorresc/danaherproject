Had a great day training with this monster from Brazil - Nicholas Meregali came in to train with the team and impressed everyone with his attacking flair and movement. It’s very impressive to see a player who trained almost entirely in a gi adapt very quickly and effectively to no gi techniques and tactics. At the end of the day Jiu jitsu is Jiu jitsu - whether you’re wearing clothing or not - the goal is to control the body and good Jiu jitsu will always do this whether the body is covered in cloth or not. Looking forward to seeing how far this immensely talented athlete can take his no gi game!
