I am very happy to announce the release today of my latest instructional video from the NEW WAVE series NO GI GUARD PASSING. When my students first burst on to the grappling scene they made their name primarily from guard pulls into leg locks. While this was a devastating and game changing approach, it was never the whole picture. No one technique or tactic, no matter how devastating, can create SUSTAINED success at the highest levels. Always the goal is a COMPLETE game that enables you to attack the whole body. If you want to exert true control over the toughest opponents you must be able to attack the upper body and back from on top. As time developed my students came to be known also for a devastating no gi passing game that supplemented their lower body game brilliantly. Understand this: IN JIU JITSU THE VAST MAJORITY OF YOUR MAT TIME WILL BE SPENT EITHER PASSING OR PLAYING GUARD POSITION. You owe it to yourself to focus on those skills  to a greater degree than any other. In this video I show the technique and tactics that enabled my students to pass the toughest guards at the highest levels. We focus on a relatively small number of passes that are particularly well suited to no gi and which combine together into a proven system to make you effective in the least time possible.
