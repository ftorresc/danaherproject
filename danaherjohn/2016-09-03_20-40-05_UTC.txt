Contingency plans: One of the few certainties of combat is this: at some point things will go wrong. When they do go wrong, they tend to do so quickly and in ways you had not anticipated. It is crucial then, that you have contingency plans worked out in advance to deal with bad situations. Half of the story of victory is not losing - you must be able to work out of potential means of losing and back into means of winning. Having clear and well defined plans for defense and escape ironically helps your offense, as it gives you the confidence to take risks on offense, knowing that if you should find yourself on the defense after failed offense, you will have the means to get out and resume your offense. If you don't believe in your defensive skills, you will avoid any kind risk that may expose that weakness. Here Gordon Ryan begins his warm up with our defensive contingency plans prior to a bout. People talked a lot about his winning offense in this match, but often overlook that it was built on the foundation of belief in his defense.
