Exciting news: Just released today is the news that a new grappling organization @kasaigrappling will be running a premium event in Brooklyn NYC December 9th with the headline event being Gordon Ryan against the great Yuri Simoes. Both Men won gold in their weight divisions in the ADCC world championships this year. Mr Simoes also won gold in the previous world championships and now has the great distinction of being a double gold medalist in two different weight categories. He is one ADCC weight class heavier than Mr Ryan. The two have met before, at EBI 6 Openweight, with Mr Ryan winning via strangle in overtime. However, Mr Simoes was not familiar with the rule set and had fought an exhausting battle with Garry Tonon in the previous match. This time he is working in a much more familiar rule set - ten minutes submission only, then if no result, six minutes overtime with all submissions legal, but IBJJF type points scored (though no advantages- there must be a positive score). Itâ€™s a tremendous match up between two great athletes in their top form. Mr Ryan will be juggling training in Gi, EBI open weight training, MMA training and this event as well! Should be an interesting holiday season! ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜œ Very happy to hear about the emergence of a new high level grappling show in NYC- it is run by Rolles Gracie - a man who truly understands the game and the athletes- this first show sounds like a firecracker! There will also be a superstar eight man tournament on the same night that I will talk about soon!
