Setting the goals: First day of @evolvemma super seminar here in Singapore. Whatever form of training you engage in - ALWAYS START WITH A CLEAR SENSE OF WHERE YOU WANT TO GET TO. Here we begin with an outline of what we want to accomplish over the week of work together. Then it’s a matter of adding the details to get to the goal. When it’s time to make progress, nothing will dismay you more than hard work in the wrong direction that leads you no closer to your goal, and nothing will make you happier than setting a goal, working intelligently towards it and finally attaining it. Thus must you start every enterprise great or small with the question of where you want to get to - only then can you commit yourself fully to the time and effort required to get there.
