The ideal of classical Jiu jitsu is to use your legs to fight your opponents upper body: One of the defining elements in the sport of Jiu jitsu it is the heavy emphasis it puts on using the LEGS as the primary means of connection and control of an opponents body. The mount, knee on belly and rear mount are the only pins that score in Jiu jitsu - and they all use the legs to connect to opponents upper body. The guard is the only acceptable bottom position and it uses the legs to connect to opponent. In top position the whole game is to prevent an opponent connecting to you with his legs because of how dangerous that can be. The best submissions holds either use the legs directly (triangles, arm bar) to control and finish opponents or indirectly to anchor you to an opponent (rear strangle etc). If youâ€™re doing most of your work with your hand and arms - YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG. Make sure every time you train you make the mental association between your legs and your opponent. Make sure the bulk of the workload is done by your legs. Be sure to emphasize training your legs for flexibility and strength over everything else. Your legs are the key to greatness in this game
