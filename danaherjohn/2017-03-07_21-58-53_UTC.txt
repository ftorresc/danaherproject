Squad style seminar in LA - Featuring Gordon Ryan: Fresh off his third EBI title this weekend, Gordon Ryan will be teaching a seminar this Saturday at my good friend and team mate, Shawn Williams dojo this Saturday March 11. I am very excited about this - it's a great opportunity for our Californian fans to see up close some NYC style jiu jitsu. Of all my students, Mr Ryan has the deepest knowledge of my back attack system. A common misunderstanding of our system is that it is merely a refinement of already existing systems. Mr Ryan will have no problems dispelling that misunderstanding with his deep knowledge of this critical aspect of our game. Mr Ryan, like all my senior students is very innovative and independent. He has developed many additional additional elements, not only of back attacks, but throughout his game, that go beyond my teachings and are his own invention - many of them are incredibly effective. One of my proudest days as a coach occurred when Gordon Ryan and Garry Tonon taught some moves at a charity seminar in front of myself and My sensei, Renzo Gracie. Mr Gracie turned to me and said admiringly , "these guys teach like college professors." Mr Ryan excels (like all my students) in leg attacks, kimura, front headlock, triangle(sankaku) and armbar (Juji gatame). Whatever he chooses to teach, I promise you, you will learn and profit from. Hoping our Californian fans enjoy the seminar as much as the ebi show! You won't find a better teacher or a better host school in which to learn. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š @banevis @jeffreyschu
