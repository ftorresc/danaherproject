Hold â€˜em by the nose and punch â€˜em in the face: Those words were famously said by General Patton to describe the idea of devastating aggression - if an opponent canâ€™t move while youâ€™re hitting him - you are twice as threatening to him as usual. So too in grappling. Getting your body into position to attack someone is never easy. It becomes a lot easier if you can hold them in place somehow first, and then swing the rest of your body into a devastating attacking position. We arenâ€™t allowed to hold opponents by the nose in Jiu jitsu (Iâ€™m very grateful for that because Iâ€™ve got a big nose so Iâ€™d really be in trouble! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜œ) but we can hold them in place with something even better - Kimura - and then bring the rest of our body into the attack, usually with triangles, arm bars, back attacks and leg attacks. Here, Craig Jones uses a very well applied Kimura grip to immobilize an opponent so that he can swing his legs into attacking position - he now has the full choice of his favorite weapons - triangles, arm bars, back attacks - or going downstairs for the legs. So, Hold â€˜em by the arm and (no - no punches in the nose) and attack them with your legs!
