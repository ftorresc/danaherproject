Weekend of victory: Squad juniors, Frank Rosenthal and Jason Rau had a great weekend at Pilgrim Grappling Championships in Philadelphia over the weekend. They were the main event matches. Mr Rosenthal took on EBI Combat Jiu Jujitsu Champion Chad Georges and had a great victory in overtime using elements of our back system to lock in a winning strangle and continue his impressive win streak. Jason Rau won in regulation time via Kata Gatame strangle in regulation time over Quentin Rosenweig, a very tough EBI competitor. Itâ€™s great to see both athletes showing they are at that EBI level and rising fast. Outstanding female blue belt, Katya Leontyeva had a tremendous day, winning advanced category gold in both her weight and absolute divisions - every match by heel hook! Today Mr Rosenthal and Ms Leontyeva showed their impressive work ethic by coming back to the gym next day to help Gordon Ryan train in anticipation of his big match next weekend with the great Vinny Margalhaes in Los Angeles. Wonderful to see such progress and the work ethic that makes it possible.
