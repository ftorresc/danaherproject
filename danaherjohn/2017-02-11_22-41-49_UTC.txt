Jiu jitsu and human spirit: Some of the best experiences I have had through jiu jitsu have nothing to do with competition or titles, but instead work at the level of social work and human advancement. A dear student of mine, Claude Levy, often travels to Africa for work and family. When a true jiu jitsu student travels, jiu jitsu travels with him! Mr Levy often teaches friends and impromptu classes with locals in the kingly art. The amazing thing about jiu jitsu is that as soon as people feel it, they immediately take note of its value - even if they have no prior experience. Getting jiu jitsu out into the world is always a good thing. Who knows - a spark can light a fire and a fire can become a blaze and a blaze become an inferno. Who is to say where the next great champion will come from? Is it not possible that casual exposure to a new art could not set in motion events that could create something truly significant? That is why I love to see students carry jiu jitsu wherever they go. Mr Levy teaches to games keepers who often use grappling technique to restrain poachers who threaten endangered African wildlife - a cause that is particularly dear to my heart. Every serious jiu jitsu student has a teacher inside of them somewhere - the learning experience is so intense that we love to reenact it as teacher. Whilst competition may be the means of gaining distinction in jiu jitsu - There will always be more pleasure in jiu jitsu as a means of bringing people together than any competition.
