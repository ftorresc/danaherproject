Your finishing rate is heavily influenced by your entering rate: when we think of what it is that makes some people finish a move successfully on many occasions we typically think it is due to that athletes excellence in mechanical efficiency. Because his performance of the move is mechanically strong, he succeeds with it often. There is certainly a lot of truth to this idea - superior mechanical execution of a move will definitely raise the number of times you succeed with it. However, there is another very important factor that determines the number of finishes you get with a given move - how many times per match you get yourself in a position to attempt it. Itâ€™s very simple - other things being equal, the more times you get to attempt a move, the more times you will end up finishing it. As such, you must start becoming systematic about your entries into your favorite moves. What are the main types of entry? How do they compliment and interact with each other? Under what circumstances do we apply each? For example, when entering legs for ashi garami based keg kicks from bottom position the three most important categories of entry will always be ELEVATION METHODS, INVERSION METHODS (pictured here) and ROLLING METHODS. Each of these three methods has sub variations within it and each can lead into three main versions of ashi garami. Once you start looking into entries in this manner you will see that it is a huge and fascinating topic. Moreover, it is a vital topic, as the more you can enter into potential match winning opportunities - the more potential there is for victory
