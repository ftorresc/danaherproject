The company I make instructional videos for @bjj.fanatics is having their company anniversary sale this week with 35% of all my instructional videos! I am very happy to say that we will be donating from this sale to FEED AMERICA charity - an relief organization that organizes free meals for underprivileged and unemployed Americans struggling during the covid crises that has left more than 40 million Americans unemployed. I believe the sale goes through to August 7. If youâ€™ve been looking for a chance to see how the squad does what they do - now is  your chance!
