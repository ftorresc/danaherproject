I am very happy to announce the release of my new instructional video BJJ FUNDAMENTALS: GO FURTHER FASTER - PIN ESCAPES AND TURTLE ESCAPES with @bjj.fanatics today! This instructional series covers the fundamental positional skills of Jiu Jitsu. The  entire sport of Jiu Jitsu is founded upon positional skills - as the old saying goes - position before submission. Only when these skills are strong can a submission game be built upon that secure foundation. Probably the single biggest problem that most people encounter when they first begin the sport of Jiu Jitsu is getting pinned helplessly in side pins, north/south pins, mounted pins and rear mount pins - so learning to get quickly and efficiently out of these troublesome situations is the first skill developing students need to master to create forward progress in Jiu Jitsu. An interesting feature of this first installment of the GO FURTHER FASTER series is that for part of it I am joined by my old friend Shawn Williams to demonstrate some of the moves! We started the beginner program at the Renzo Gracie Academy together many years ago and it was fun going over some of the material we taught in those classes that helped take so many developing students, including a young Georges St-Pierre, towards their Jiu Jitsu goals. There is a link in my Instagram bio for those who are interested ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š As much as I love cutting edge Jiu Jitsu and innovation, my deepest attraction to the sport will always be to the fundamentals - that is where the heart and soul of the sport resides and the well from which all Jiu Jitsu excellence comes.
