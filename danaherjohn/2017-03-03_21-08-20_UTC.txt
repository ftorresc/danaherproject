Rising to the top: As a coach I always love to watch the most essential dynamic of a healthy training room - the work done by junior students (kohai) to rise to senior status (Senpai). Watching the growth of the juniors is always uplifting to me as a coach and is the best feedback I get as to the relative health of the training program I run. A notable addition to the ranks of the kohai is a young student of my great friend and teammate Matt Serra, Jason Rau. He came to us with a strong positional game and has taken to our methods very well indeed. Keep your eye on the progress of this talented young man. Next week he will compete in a tournament that has helped launch so many of our kohai to the next level - Sapeteiro 7. It will feature a sixteen man tournament featuring many outstanding grapplers, some of whom are in this weekends EBI event. It will be at a weight of 175 pounds and the athletes will duke it out for two thousand shekels in what should be a thrilling experience for the competitors and the fans. I'm looking forward to a display of skills from Mr Rau blending old school positional skill with squad style submission work ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠWorking out with him are fellow kohai Matthew Tesla and Frankie Rosenthal along with MMA legend Jake Shields - here they work their armlock Juji gatame drills before getting into sparring
