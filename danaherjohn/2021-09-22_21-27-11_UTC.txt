The most fundamental forms of control over the human body will always be control over the HIPS and the HEAD. Interestingly, in most cases you have to choose one or the other (there are some powerful exceptions). In most cases of top positional control, we start with the hips and progress to the head, since the hips are typically closer. Make a deep study of hip control and head control and your game will improve greatly
