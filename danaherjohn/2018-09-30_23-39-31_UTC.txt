A sense of direction: When you have a clear sense of direction and know exactly what you want to do in a bout and have the skills to get it done, you will not only be a difficult person indeed to stop - you will usually get what you want in very little time. Here is Frank Rosenthal going on a leg lock rampage this weekend - ending his match in seconds via outside heel hook. I always look to coach A STRONG FIRST MOVE THAT WILL EITHER GET AN IMMEDIATE BREAKTHROUGH OR CREATE OVERLY DEFENSIVE REACTIONS THAT WILL SET UP SUBSEQUENT MOVES. Very often a well performed strong first move will be all that is required. All my students excel in creating pressure from the outset even when the opponent knows what to expect. This often results in very quick victories like this leg lock blitz. You must train this aspect of the game - know what you want and practice until you can get there quickly - the results can be astounding
