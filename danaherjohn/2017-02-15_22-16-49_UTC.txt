Smooth Operator: The most important gauge of how well you are progressing in jiu jitsu will always be your performance in sparring and contests against a wide range of opponents. Some athletes can have a rough and tumble style and be very effective with it. There is a lot to be said however, for a smooth, aesthetically pleasing style (provided it is effective of course). Indeed, I would go further and say that aesthetics can be linked to performance. Smoothness is suggestive of EFFICIENCY- which is a huge factor in performance. I always encourage my athletes to work with aesthetics in mind. I find that pride in the aesthetics of their work creates a mindset where they constantly look for efficiency in movement - a mindset that will greatly benefit their long term development in the sport. Here, outstanding kohai student, Oliver Taza shows fine form with a very efficient drop into ashi garami followed by heel hook variation. His relaxed demeanor makes for a smooth entry into the move that does not convey his intentions to his opponent  in this very short match at a recent local grappling event. Mr Taza is preparing for his EBI debut in less than a month and used this contest as part of his preparation for the big show.
