Upcoming action: Gordon Ryan, having just won EBI 11, will soon be back in action. At EBI 11 he fought at his actual weight - 170 pounds. Normally he cannot compete at that weight, as team mate Garry Tonon usually competes there. As he result, most of his competition outings have been well above his real weight. Once again he will face a bigger and stronger foe in the form of Lucas "Hulk" Barbossa, an outstanding competitor from team Atos, who has won world championships in both gi and no gi competition. Mr Barbossa has recently been competing at light heavyweight- taking the five grappling championship title over other jiu jitsu standouts like Leandro Lo and Tarsis Humphreys to show he is competing at the very highest levels. It will be a short match of eight minutes of submission only followed by a judges decision based on submission attempts and control. Mr Ryan is training diligently as always and constantly experimenting and refining his techniques- he will need to if he is to prevail against such a powerful and talented foe. Great to see Fight to Win grappling organization putting on such great shows and high level match ups.
