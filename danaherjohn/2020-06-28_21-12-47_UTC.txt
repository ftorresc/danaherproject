Variations: For any given move in Jiu jitsu there are many variations. It is crucial for your development that when you find a move that suits you well, you study it deeply and come to know all its variations and how these work together. Only in this way can you exploit the full potential of a given move. Think of the triangle - one of the most commonly seen and effective submissions in the sport. Most people talk about THE triangle - as though there was only one type. In fact you have the front triangle (the most well known and common variant in Jiu jitsu), side triangle, rear triangle, reverse triangle and back to front triangle - and within each of those main variations there are sub variations. Each is well suited to a specific task. Learning to use them together to cover every possible contingency as you grapple is the basis of your path to mastery. Here, Garry Tonon  applies a beautiful and shockingly tight sub variant of the front triangle that creates a very tight strangle indeed.
