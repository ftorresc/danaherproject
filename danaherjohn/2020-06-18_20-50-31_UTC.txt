In a world of confusion those who have a clear sense of where they want to be will prevail: Some of the scramble situations we find ourselves in Jiu jitsu can be totally disorienting. Both athletes head over heels and spinning like tops. It is crucial that you be able to go from this common type of scenario and emerge in a good situation, or at least, a better one than your opponent. The key to this is to have a small set of goals as to where you want to maneuver towards as you tumble around around each - so that you are working towards those goals even as you tumble. When the tumbling stops - you can emerge in a winning position. Donâ€™t just scramble for the sake of scrambling - scramble towards something. Being someone mostly interested in submission I usually like to aim towards some form of leg entanglement in a heated scramble. Variations of ashi garami are almost always available and when the scramble is done you are in a potentially match winning position or a good position to sweep for a reversal. You might have different preferences and aim for juji gatame arm bars in a scramble, or a Kimura, whatever you prefer - just have a prior goal at the onset of a scramble to make sure you got something good in your hand at the end of the scramble.
