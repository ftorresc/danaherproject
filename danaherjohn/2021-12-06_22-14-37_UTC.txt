A life of routine: We talk about a routine life as though it’s a bad thing - disparaging it as dull and boring and indicative of failed life choices. Let me be clear - almost all of our progress and achievement in life is founded upon the acquisition of skills, and skills are only acquired through the maintenance of a routine that gives you sufficient time and repetition to let them develop. If you want progress in Jiu jitsu or any other aspect in life, you will need to establish a routine and everything else in your life will have to be arranged around that routine. That doesn’t mean you have to condemn yourself to a dull life of boredom - but it does mean that you will have to avoid anything that interrupts the routine in a significant way. Routine isn’t something to be disparaged - on the contrary - it is the source and wellspring of your greatest resource - skill - and if you wish to rise to the top of your domain it will be skills developed by adherence to that routine that allow you to do so.
