Working for advantage: Most of the game of jiu jitsu is the business of gaining some form of preliminary advantage and once advantage is attained, launching a decisive attack with the intention of finishing the match. In the beginner levels, advantage is typically understood only in terms of relative position - getting past your opponents legs into upper body pins. As you go higher into the sport the notion of advantage must be greatly expanded. Here I work with young standout Nicky Ryan, who at fifteen years of age has a very deep understanding of advantage in grappling.
We are battling simultaneously for balance and foot position advantage and it looks like Mr Ryan is doing a better job than me! Time to abandon ship! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
