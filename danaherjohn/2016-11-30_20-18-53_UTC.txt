First workout of the day - New York City: Second workout of the day - Mexico City: At the airport now, waiting for flight to Mexico in prep for EBI 10, Just finishing working with Messrs Gordon and Nicky Ryan who are training brilliantly. Looking forward to seeing Mr Cummings and crew and getting in some more prep work for the big show. Mr Cummings always greatly impresses me in training, but never more than in his training for this show. Looking forward to the change in venue and hats off to Mr Bravo and his great crew for helping to grow this great sport in new directions with such an exciting line up of talent for this lightweight event. Looks like the thin air of Mexico City has had some strange effects on Ottavia Bourdain and Mr Garry Tonon...ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
