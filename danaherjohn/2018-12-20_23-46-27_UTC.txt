Learning from videos: People often ask me if you can learn martial arts techniques from video. I truly believe that insights from video instruction PROVIDED THEY ARE REINFORCED AND DEVELOPED BY REGULAR TRAINING ON THE MAT CAN ABSOLUTELY ADD SIGNIFICANTLY TO YOUR SKILL SET. You may recognize this man - this is Placido Carl Santos - he is the demonstration partner in many of my videos and trains in Boston. One day we were filming some material for IBJJF legal leg locks and I showed him several variations of Achilles locks that I use, subtly different from the standard grips and body placement. Mr Santos took the lesson in the same way any viewer would and we moved on quickly to the next techniques. Then a few weeks later at a local tournament he got the chance to make use of the lesson. Here he is getting a quick submission victory via the Achilles lock he learned in the video shoot ðŸ˜‰
