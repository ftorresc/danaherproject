Increasing strength, endurance, tenacity and all the other attributes of your body and mind will lead to small performance increases that will increase your chance of success at the highest level; but be aware that whatever performance increases you get from improvement in that direction is minuscule compared with the performance increases of five, six, seven or eightfold that you can derive from increases in technical and tactical nuance. Your triangle for example, can be improved a little by making your legs stronger; but it can be improved massively (and immediately) by shifting your leg positioning by just a few inches - This is where the core of performance increases will always come from
