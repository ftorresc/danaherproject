Working against resistance: Everything you do in Jiu Jitsu is done against strong resistance by someone who probably knows the moves you are attempting and knows the counters to those moves. This makes for a situation where you will GENERALLY FAIL MORE OFTEN THAN YOU SUCCEED in the application of your moves. You must get used to this fundamental fact of live sparring and competition - understand that failure is only temporary and that you always have options to follow up with subsequent attacks. Victory almost always goes to the athlete who can SUSTAIN ATTACKS OVER TIME until a breakthrough is achieved. As you feel strong resistance take confidence in the fact that you are offensive and he is defensive and that if you can maintain this long enough you WILL break through no matter how tough the resistance feels.
