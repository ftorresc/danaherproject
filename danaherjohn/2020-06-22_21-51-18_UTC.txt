In all combat,  victory will almost always go to the one who, to a greater degree than his rival, KNOWS WHAT HE IS DOING and and has the PHYSICAL ABILITY to do it along with the CONFIDENCE to implement it when the moment of opportunity arises. Thus victory is the meeting point of knowledge, physical skill/preparation and confidence. Spend your time developing these three factors and you will experience victory far more often than defeat.
