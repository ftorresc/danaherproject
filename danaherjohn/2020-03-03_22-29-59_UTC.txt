Sometimes you just know you done f**ked up...One of the surest signs of progress in Jiu Jitsu is understanding WHY you lost. We all know that feeling of “oh no...i just f**ked up.” Its good that you have those feelings - it’s a sign of progress. The worst feeling is getting beating and not knowing why or how - then you cannot even begin to improve your performance. Losing is never a pleasant thing, but losing and NOT KNOWING WHY is completely intolerable since it takes away the VALUE OF LOSING AS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE. Whenever you lose a match or experience some form of failure that feel is important, never just take the loss and move on. The idea is to analyze it and make corrections. Losing is entirely normal and completely forgivable - but losing without analysis and modification to create a better you is not. Just as important as your training sessions are you post training debriefings, where you must go through the good and bad aspects of the session and propose changes for the next one. Only when each session is followed by analysis can one session benefit the next and progress over time be made. Your physical training training stops the moment you leave the mat, but your mental training does not.
