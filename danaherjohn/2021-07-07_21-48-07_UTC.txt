Priorities: Itâ€™s a common thing to see a young student attacking enthusiastically from the back and focus too much on the submission rather than positional maintenance. If the attack fails they also lose the position as well as the submission. Remember, as long has you hold the position, you can fail repeatedly and keep trying and again and again until you get the breakthrough. As such, prioritize the position over any given submission attempt. SUBMISSION FAILURE IS ACCEPTABLE IF YOU MAINTAIN POSITIONAL INTEGRITY, BUT IF YOU LOSE POSITION YOU LOSE  EVERYTHING. When you go for your submissions from the back, monitor your positional robustness at all times. If you ever feel that being compromised - STOP - and recover positional integrity. As long as you do this you can always go back to try again with your submissions
