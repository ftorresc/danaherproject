When the fighting is over: Garry Tonon finishes another impressive performance. The self analysis that must follow every match has already begun as we reflect on his immediate assessment of the match. His initial feelings and thoughts are the first part of the process. As the next few days unfold, the analysis will deepen into video review and a congress of informed opinions, so that training and behavior can be modified in the light of experience. Only in this way can progress be made over time. Only in this way can an athlete build strength upon strength and put on increasingly better shows. Most people celebrate a win. The best analyze a win and see where improvements can be made so that winning becomes a habit rather than an accident.
