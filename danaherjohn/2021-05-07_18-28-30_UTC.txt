Visitors: We always love having visitors come by and train - they always provide new perspectives and challenges that help growth in all directions. Today we had the privilege of working with world class wrestlers associated with the Penn State program! @jaimeespinalpr @ant_thechamp_cassar @_joshrodriguez_  They showed how at the end of the day, all grappling styles are related - learning some Jiu jitsu applications of their wrestling skills they had a great workout with the squad! Once we open up our own place with more mat space we look forward to hosting more visitors and growing this sport some more!
