Half guard passing and MMA/fighting: Modern Jiu jitsu has many exciting and very effective methods of guard passing that have risen to prominence in last decade.

When I used to coach George St Pierre for his passing/top control, the overwhelming majority of training time was spent in forcing half guard and passing from there. No other method adapts so well to the rigors and demands of MMA than pressure passing from half guard.

I can confidently attest that no other method of guard passing adapts so well to gi, no gi and MMA as half guard passing does.
