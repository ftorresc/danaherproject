Garry Tonon back at work the morning after victory: I am always impressed by a strong work ethic and no one surpasses that of Garry Tonon. Here he is the morning after his big victory last night at @onechampionship here in Singapore teaching at the big Squad Super Seminar at @evolvemma teaching how to escape from the very move he used last night to get another big win. People here are deeply impressed by Mr Tononâ€™s teaching ability. Everyone already knew he was a great athlete but everyone here is amazed at the clarity and effectiveness of his teaching as well. Soon he will be making an instructional video with @bjj.fanatics on his mastery of escapes! Keep your eyes peeled for that one!!
