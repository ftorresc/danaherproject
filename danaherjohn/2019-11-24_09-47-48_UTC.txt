Victory in Hawaii!! Garry Tonon took on the great Davi Ramos, ADCC champion here in Honolulu tonight in an epic fifteen minute battle between two masters of submission. Both men came out firing their big guns - leg attacks, arm attacks and strangles - all in combinations. The match went from floor to standing and back again at a furious pace. Around the ten minute mark it was becoming clear that the pace was straining the bigger man and Gary Tonon began to take over. As time narrowed, Mr Tonon hit a beautiful go behind to take the back and locked in a full strangle hold just as time expired! It was an amazing match that showcased how pace, movement and tactical threat can exhaust bigger and stronger opponents - even those of the highest quality. Now itâ€™s back to NYC to get Gordon Ryan ready to face the great Bo Nickals in a hybrid jiu jitsu/wrestling match that should be another spectacle!! Hope you all enjoyed the show!!
