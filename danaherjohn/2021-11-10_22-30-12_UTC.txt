Beginners in Jiu jitsu ignore their opponents grips and entanglements because they donâ€™t understand the dangers they lead to. As they learn and develop expertise they come to see the danger and start to break grips as soon as they become a threat. But the very best athletes go back to the start and ignore grips - this time not from ignorance, but from the knowledge that if you reach a high enough level you can let an opponent take any grip he likes and use it as the opening to your own attacks. The opponents grip becomes a shortcut to your own offense.
