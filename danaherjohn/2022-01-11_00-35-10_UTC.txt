Back in Boston! Iâ€™m happy to be back in Boston for a few days with two great students Placido and Giancarlo filming more videos for BJJ Fanatics. Always a pleasure to experience the four seasons in the North East (Iâ€™m lying - itâ€™s fucking freezing and I miss Texas warmth already ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚) Now itâ€™s time to get organized for tomorrow and get back to work! Wishing you all the best from Boston! ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—
