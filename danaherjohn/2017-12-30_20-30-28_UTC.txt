In a sport where everyone is doing their best to keep moving forward and improve - just maintaining what you have been doing and remaining stationary is effectively moving backwards. Being content with your past successes is a guaranteed way to ensure future failures. Keep working hard as 2018 approaches. The techniques and tactics of our sport are limitless- itâ€™s up to you to take advantage of that. Photo @banejitsu
