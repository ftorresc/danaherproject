Champion attitude: It was a breakthrough weekend for Ethan Crelinsten, one of the squad's Canadian contingent - he won gold at the West Coast ADCC trials and a ticket to the World Championships later this year with a tremendous performance in what may have been the largest trials event in ADCC history. Winning is impressive in itself, but the nature of the victories made it a truly standout performance - he won every match by submission save for his bout with team mate Nicky Ryan. I always enjoy teaching our Canadian students. They make big sacrifices to travel so far to train with us. They remind me of my early coaching days when a young Georges St-Pierre would travel all the way to NYC to build his dream. The kind of dedication it takes was much in evidence today - Ethan Crelinsten came back to the gym for two hard grappling workouts just one day after winning the biggest event of His life. This is exactly the attitude I like to see. Most people are satisfied with any form of success and stop - champions see an initial success as a stepping stone to greater success in the future and immediately get back to work
