Getting it right: Talented and industrious squad junior, Frank Rosenthal had a superb performance Saturday night at @kasaigrappling championships winning via inside heel hook. You can see him perform flawlessly many of the central themes of our approach to the leg locking game - a fine ankle lace ashi garami ties his opponent up and immobilizes him to allow transitions to a tight closed wedge (in this case, inside sankaku) around the hip and then perfect head position to generate heel exposure on a now stationary target - result? A completely controlled submission on a tough and skillful opponent from 10th Planet who simply runs out of defensive options as the system unfolds on stage. Great result for Mr Rosenthal in his best performance so far and a great example to the other juniors and classmates and indeed, all of you, in the calm and disciplined execution of well rehearsed skills in a pressure situation.
