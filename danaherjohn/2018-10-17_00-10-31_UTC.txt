In a well applied guillotine there is a concerted attempt to turn your opponents head and neck into a structurally weak position. Here you can clearly see this in operation as Garry Tonon applies a devastating high elbow guillotine on Kim Terra, the very talented brother of Caio. You can clearly see the turning of the head into a forced and unnatural position that shuts down effective defense and greatly facilitates the strangle. This is achieved mostly by the interplay between your hips and the elbow of your strangle arm - you can see this interplay very well here.
