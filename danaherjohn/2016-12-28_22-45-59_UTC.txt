Big plans for new year at Renzo Gracie Academy: Sensei Renzo Gracie has done an incredible job of bringing in the expertise of Judo superstar Jimmy Pedro and Fuji mat company to install new mats at RGA NYC!! Over the Christmas break our staff and team Fuji have been hard at work installing the mats and painting to give the academy what must be the best footing for grappling I have ever seen! The new mats look and feel incredible! I had the honor of teaching the first class on the new surface in our small room - it felt like I was teaching in a new gym! ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜Š The squad came in full force and were joined by child prodigy Mikey Wilson and MMA superstar Jake Shields - who fights this Saturday in WSOF. He looked great on the mats today doing his submission work with squad members. The professionalism and production of team Fuji is impressive to behold. The blue basement has been transformed to a very eye pleasing blue and grey ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜Š Sensei once told me that the best investment a man can make is in himself. That is exactly what he is doing now - he is investing in his dojo in a way that is transforming it daily ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜Š Looking forward to a new year of training, goal setting and achievements at our "new" headquarters ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜ŠğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡·ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜ŠHuge thanks to Sensei, Mr Jimmy Pedro, Team Fuji, RGA staff and our loyal students who come in every day to train around the temporary inconvenience of construction and change ğŸ˜‰ to come in an improve their skills ğŸ˜Š The academy has never looked better!
