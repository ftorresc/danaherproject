Ethan Crelinsten wins EBI Overtime event! Outstanding squad junior Ethan Crelinsten, one of our Canadian representatives, out in a near flawless performance last night to win the new EBI overtime event, a new version of EBI that only uses the distinctive overtime period of the old EBI competition format as the basis of the event. In the old EBI there was a ten minute submission only regulation period. If there was no submission the two athletes went into overtime with a choice of starting either on the back or juji gatame arm bar position. This was an exciting and viewer friendly format that proved very popular and was an excellent way to showcase the leg lock revolution that changed the face of submission grappling. I was always very proud of the fact that the three senior squad students, Garry Tonon, Eddie Cummings and Gordon Ryan, all achieved the remarkable feat of submitting all their opponents in regulation time on the way to their victories (I think Garry May have done it twice). Eddie Bravo shelved the old format in favor of combat Jiu Jitsu but recently brought in the idea of overtime competition. I think the idea was that Many athletes now simply stall in the regulation time with the intention of winning in overtime, so the idea was to cut to the chase and go from the start where it was likely to end up. Our back attack system is very well suited to EBI overtime format and Mr Crelinsten showed the depth of his knowledge training in this very unforgiving position - he won three of four match via strangle and won the final decisively on riding time. It was a great performance and shows well the spirit of training hard to reach for ever higher goals - well done Ethan!!
