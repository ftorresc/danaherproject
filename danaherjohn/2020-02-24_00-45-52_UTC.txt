Understanding your legs: A distinguishing characteristic of Jiu Jitsu is the tremendous emphasis out upon grappling your opponent primarily with your LEGS. The guard position in all its many variations is stressed more than any other. It is important therefore that you understand the broad principles that enable your legs to be an effective weapon in the fight from bottom position. Understand that the HIPS are the engine room of the guard position. They provide the power and position that underlies guard play. By shifting side to side and slowing you to move between seated and supine positions they can out you in a position to attack and defend effectively. The KNEES are your shield in defense - the closer to your torso the stronger your defense - as long as you present two knees in front or around your opponents waist/hips (open and closed guard) or around one of his legs (half guard ) you are defensively sound and have the possibility of offense from underneath. Your FEET solidify the connection/grip of your legs upon your opponent. They transmit the power of your hips and knees in meaningful ways to your opponents body. Donâ€™t just touch your opponent with your feet - GRIP him with your feet - and you will be able to use your legs as you do your arms. We spend all our lives using our hands and arms for a multitude of difficult tasks without thought - Jiu Jitsu asks you to do the same with your feet and legs - when you do, you will be a very dangerous opponent from underneath.
