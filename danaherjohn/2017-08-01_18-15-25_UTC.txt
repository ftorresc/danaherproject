Jake shields getting it done: This last weekend squad regular Jake Shields took on Danny Davis in an MMA fight in Professional Fighters League in Washington. With the primary interest this weekend on the big UFC event, it is easy to overlook Mr Shields fight - but remember, as the two UFC welterweights Tyron Woodley and Demian Maia fought for the coveted UFC world title, Jake Shields has beaten both men in UFC competition in the past. His career record is littered with victories over UFC champions. He out on a dominant performance, getting two 10-8 rounds with positional pressure that melts opponents. Great to see Mr Shields taking his skills from the gym to the cage again and taking another impressive victory.
