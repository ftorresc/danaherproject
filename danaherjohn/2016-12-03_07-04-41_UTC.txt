A great night for submission grappling and jiu jitsu tonight in Mexico City at EBI 10. Geo Martinez successfully defended his 135 pound title against Eddie Cummings in a thrilling final match. We are all immensely proud of Mr Cummings - he showed his amazing skills in leg attacks again tonight, scoring quick submissions on the path to the final. In the final he was able to dominate the attacks in regulation time but Mr Martinez did a fine job of getting through to overtime where he was able to take a fine victory. Hats off to the EBI staff who put on an amazing event in Mexico City and Geo Martinez and team 10th planet for an exceptional performance. The squad will do as we always do -
Back to the basement to work on our skills to emerge stronger, smarter and ready to compete again when the opportunity presents itself. Thank you to all our social media supporters for your support in the lead up to the big show. Tonight we rest, but tomorrow we train. Messrs Gordon Ryan, Garry Tonon and Nicky Ryan must now prepare for the next big show - the year finale - in San Diego against very strong opposition. Can't wait to get back to the blue basement and get the squad together watch the action unfold ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š Special thanks to Mr Eddie Bravo and Mr Victor Davila and his son Tory who put on a such a great event - tonight was their night - congratulations
