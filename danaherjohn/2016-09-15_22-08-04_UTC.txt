Calm during the storm: Gordon Ryan displays his submission versatility with a beautiful transition from our kimura system to back control system during his run to gold at EBI 8. Interestingly I encouraged him two weeks prior to the bout to work more on kimura as a means of broadening his Arsenal for this show - he did not let me down. His opponent shows admirable poise and calm in a tough situation, but it does not matter, the end is near now as a heavily practiced transition kicks into operation that will make resistance very difficult indeed. This constant need to keep diversifying our attacks without losing our previous ones is critical to maintaining progress over time in a sport where opponents learn and adapt quickly to known threats.
