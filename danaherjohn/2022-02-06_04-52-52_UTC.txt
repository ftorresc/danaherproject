Great night of grappling in Austin: Tonight the regional grappling show FIGHT TO WIN came to Austin and put on another great show at the Sheraton Hotel. Emerging athletes Giancarlo Bodoni and Luke Griffith had outstanding performances against very tough opponents with Mr Bodoni winning with a finely applied heel hook and Mr Griffith via rear strangle - both athletes sat to guard early but used wrestling reversals from bottom to get up into top position and create the pressure needed to get their submission victories. Itâ€™s a great chance for developing athletes to get stage experience and showcase their skills in front of an audience. Thank you to Garry Tonon and Gordon Ryan for fine cornering and coaching work. Back to the gym tomorrow to keep working on those skills!
