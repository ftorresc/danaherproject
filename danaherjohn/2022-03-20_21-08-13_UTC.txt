Distance: one of the most important determinants of your actions towards an opponent when working from guard position is DISTANCE. Whichever attacks you choose to use against your opponent will have to figure in distance as the main factor in your choice. Some attacks are well suited to an opponent at long range, some at medium and some at very close range. Itâ€™s crucial that you have attacks for every range. I would rather have only three attacks from open guard but one for each of long, medium and close range; than have nine attacks at only one of these three ranges.
