Don’t tolerate controlling/dangerous grips: Oftentimes in Jiu jitsu you will feel an opponent get a good grip that feels like it controls you in some way that signals danger - a strong passing grip for example. Don’t accept it - peel it off immediately to deny the advantage. You don’t want to degenerate into a negative player who only focuses on grip denial at the expense of offense, but still, you have to take care of defensive concerns early before they become insurmountable problems, even if if means backing off the offense for a short time. Here, Georges St Pierre peels a controlling hand that could be setting up a guard pass off his knee - once having done so, he can go back into offense with confidence
