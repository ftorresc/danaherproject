Tapping - part 2: Garry Tonon got caught in a very nice triangle one week ago by a very talented athlete (Antonio Carlos Jr) and fought hard to get out but tapped when he could not. Mr Carlos Jr was caught in a triangle variation the week before by Gordon Ryan and tapped. A week after that Mr Tonon was ready to fight again and this time win. You can see that in a world of high volume matches, professionals will tap so that they can continue with their careers uninterrupted and go on to success just a short time later. If you fight at a high level, you will get caught, no matter how good you are. Better to tap and resume training immediately so that you can avoid the errors that got you in trouble and move on to a higher level of performance. Of course there can be factors that change this and make you very reluctant to tap, but in standard grappling competition this is the sensible approach and the one I always encourage my athletes to take. Here Garry Tonon enjoys the fruits of victory, a week after a loss, an hour after a win, ready to enjoy himself that night and train hard the next day in preparation for another bout in a few weeks. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜œðŸ¤•ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜ƒ#cash/chicks/championships
