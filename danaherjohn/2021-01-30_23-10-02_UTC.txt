Knowing what success feels like and what failure feels like - minimum requirements for submission holds: Submission holds are an all or nothing affair. Typically They either work completely and end the match or don’t work at all and the action continues (occasionally there are cases where they work but the opponent just keeps fighting on  with a broken limb and in these cases they have worked to some degree insofar as the rest of the match will be easier fighting against a partially crippled opponent). They take up a considerable amount of energy when applied full force against a tough opponent. You definitely don’t want to hang on grimly to a failed submission hold that has little or no chance of working and needlessly expend vast sums of precious energy fruitlessly. On the other hand, you don’t want to quit early at the first sign of resistance and lose a great chance to win. How do you distinguish scenarios where we should cut our losses and release to go on to something else versus holding on to get the win? The key is to recognize the minimum essential features to the success of the move - for example every heel hook requires that at a minimum your opponents knee should be trapped within your knee line. Every juji gatame requires at the minimum that your hips should be locked to an opponents shoulder/armpit. Every Kimura has the minimum requirement that your figure four lock should be above your opponents elbow. That minimum requirement(s) is your basic guide. If you satisfy it - it is probably a good idea to persist with the lock. If you can’t satisfy it - it’s probably a good idea to abandon it and move on to another attack. Know your minimum requirements and you will know ahead of time whether success or failure with the hold in imminent and save yourself a lot frustration
