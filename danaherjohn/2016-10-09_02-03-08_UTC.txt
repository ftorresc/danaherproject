Winners podium: Young Nicky Ryan, just fifteen years of age, went all the way to Canada after a solid camp with the squad and competed today in a super fight against local adult (31 years old) grappling stand out Danny An Khoi Vu. Nicky won via submission with a heel hook variation in around two minutes. At the same tournament, Oliver Taza entered a tournament format and defeated multiple opponents all via heel hook to win gold. Here are the two junior squad squad members enjoying victory at the Submission Series Pro event - looking forward to seeing them back in the gym as they help the squad prepare for more upcoming challenges in the near future ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
