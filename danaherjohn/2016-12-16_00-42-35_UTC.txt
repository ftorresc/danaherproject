Meanwhile....As I wait for a plane to California, Eddie Cummings waits for a plane to Costa Rica! Mr Cummings will teach the first squad seminar at the dojo of my friend and student Arturo Wesson, who regularly comes all the way to NYC to train in our method and bring that knowledge back to his students at home. I am delighted to see Mr Cummings heading south to spread our message of control leading to submission. Of all my competitive students, Mr Cummings has spent the most time with me in private classes and has the deepest knowledge of my leg attack system. He is much more than that however. Like all my students he is an independent and innovative thinker and has developed his own specialized methods that have made him arguably the finest ashi garami exponent in the world. There is a sense in which Mr Cummings is the victim of his own success - his leg attacks are so successful that few besides those he trains among have seen his other great skills. He has outstanding back attacks, superb attacks from front head lock and truly excellent armlock and triangle (juji gatame and sankaku) attacks, among others. He is a very fine teacher and I am delighted that our Costa Rican friends will get the chance to see such high level technique explained by such a fine practitioner who can really express the depth of his knowledge. If you are there - don't miss it! Just don't let him anywhere near the ice cream or pineapple juice stand or he will gain one hundred pounds of blubber in a day! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Mr Cummings will be training hard with the squad when he returns - big plans for the new year ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠStay tuned! A big hello to Costa Rican jiu jitsu in general and Mr Arturo Wesson in particular - have fun!
