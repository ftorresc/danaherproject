Pressure before submission: One of the great maxims of Jiu jitsu is “position before submission.” There is a lot of wisdom in that phrase. Understand however, that if you add pressure to position you will double the effect and create situations where opponents MENTALLY accept submission BEFORE you PHYSICALLY apply it. Remember that submission is a CHOICE. Many more people will make that choice when subjected to unrelenting pressure prior to the application of the finishing hold. When you get position, go the extra step and start applying physical pressure from there and you will be surprised to see opponents looking forward to the submission hold as it gives them an acceptable out from the unpleasant experience of PRESSURE OVER TIME.
