Unknown talents of the squad: most people know the squad has some very respectable submission skills - tonight I learned they have a whole other side to them that I never knew. After evening the workout it was time for dinner - fearless leader Garry Tonon immediately went to the kitchen with his able assistants Matthew Tesla and Ethan Crelinsten where he immediately went to work cooking a splendid feast for the entire squad!! Here he is doing his best Gordon Ramsey impression as Gordon Ryan calls out instructions from his Anthony Bourdain book in the background. Amazingly no one has died of food poisoning yet. Nicky Ryan appeared to eat more weight of food than his actual body weight while Tom DeBlass drank from a massive bottle of Pepsi in between salmon and asparagus- truly the diet of champions! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ They say from chaos comes order - there was a hell of a lot of chaos in the kitchen but a very orderly dinner was served, so I guess it's true!! Now it's bed time and on the road to the competition tomorrow ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
