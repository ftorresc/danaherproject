Getting out of a bad situation is good - but much is getting out of a bad situation and IMMEDIATELY COUNTER ATTACKING so that you seize the initiative of the match again. For every escape there is always a critical point where you have broken away - THAT is the point where your mind should switch from defense to offense and change your action from escape to attack. Donâ€™t be satisfied with getting out - aim higher and look for counter attacks  the moment you pass the threshold of escape.
