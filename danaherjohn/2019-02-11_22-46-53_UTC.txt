Iâ€™m very excited to see that one of my favorite people in grappling, the great Keenan Cornelius, is releasing a big video production of his masterful lapel guard work. I believe Mr Cornelius is one of the most innovative and forward thinking athletes in Gi BJJ today. His innovative lapel guard has been tying up and controlling the toughest opponents at the highest levels in a way that is extraordinarily impressive. I got a chance to chat with him again at the ADCC trials and it sounds like a fantastic project! Check out the link to his video work in my Instagram story ðŸ˜Š
