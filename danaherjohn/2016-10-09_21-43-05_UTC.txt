Pre-contact: Due to the very nature of grappling, which requires us to have some form of grip upon our opponent in order to be able work the moves, most people have a tendency to underestimate the importance of skills utilized prior to establishing our grips. It is very important to understand that the game begins BEFORE EITHER ATHLETE HAS LAID A FINGER UPON THE OTHER. As the two athletes approach each other, they should be working to gain advantage before a grip has even been taken. This can be done through stance, movement, angle, level and limb positioning. Subtle use of these factors as we approach an opponent prior to making grips can result in advantage that will give us the initiative as we enter the grappling engagement. Good athletes don't wait until they establish contact to begin the fight for advantage - they begin as soon as they approach an opponent so that by the time contact has made, they already are a step ahead - then it's a battle to keep moving from advantage to advantage until victory. As in most areas of life, he who begins with advantage generally has an easier time in a competitive setting, jiu jitsu is no exception to this general rule. Here, Nicky Ryan has begun maneuvering to advantage with hands feet and stance before contact has even been made in his superfight in Canada yesterday. The small advantages he was able able to gain prior to contact translated into bigger advantage as the match progressed until he got his victory via heel hook.
