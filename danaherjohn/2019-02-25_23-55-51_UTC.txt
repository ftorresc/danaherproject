Getting ready: @garrytonon is preparing to go back to fight for the fourth time in @onechampionship in Tokyo Japan on March 31st. The transition from Jiu Jitsu to MMA is always a long and arduous one. It has been about a year since his first fight now and his progress has been astounding - but still a long way to go. Despite the new direction we never forget where we come from and Garry is proud to carry the Jiu Jitsu/submission grappling flag into the cage. A big part of what we are trying to do is show that the power of submission holds applies in all domains and that locks and strangles can play the same role as KO punches in a fight - as devastating and highly effective weapons that can thrill an audience and end a fight at any time. On the other hand, we are realists and only a fool would claim that grappling is all you need in MMA. Training in striking is essential also, even if it is not your main weapon. Itâ€™s a fascinating journey and nothing is more interesting and challenging to me as a coach than the complex interplay between striking and grappling. Another day on the mats and in the cage - lots more to go ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
