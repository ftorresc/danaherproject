Fine tuning: Garry Tonon gets some light tag sparring in tonight in Bangkok in preparation for his debut here Saturday night. Obviously intensity levels diminish sharply in the last week but there are always ways to train and improve without maximum power. Watching the young grappling master take on the entirely new world of striking is as fascinating to me as it can be frustrating to him ðŸ˜œ As always however, his learning speed is very impressive and his work ethic even more so. Now itâ€™s dinner time as we are now joined by @tomdeblass and @jakeshields and Mr Tononâ€™s mother here for a night in Bangkok. Wishing you all the best and thank you all for your support in this merging of the squadâ€™s submission grappling base with MMA.
