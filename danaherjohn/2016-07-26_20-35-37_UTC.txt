Teaching atmosphere: Visiting students are often quite surprised by the informal and relaxed teaching style we use. I am blessed to have highly motivated students which allows me to teach in this way. The high standards quickly create an atmosphere where the lazy and unmotivated either quickly reform themselves or seek calmer waters. I always teach to the best people in the room. I find this has a way of lifting everyone's level regardless of belt rank and pulls the best out of everyone. Though some students may initially struggle with this, I have grown to have great faith in people's ability to adapt and improve according to the level of the room as a whole.  In a short time, they rise in level and make the needed improvements to keep up. A key role is played by the senior students, who often provide inspiration and informal help. Less advanced students can easily observe that the more successful ones have good learning habits - they pay close attention to instruction, spar in an experimental rather than win at all costs manner, and place equal emphasis upon offense and defense in training. Here Eddie Cummings shows his typical attention level in a mixed gi and no gi class. Even when the technique shown (a standing throw utilizing the gi) does not apply to his immediate situation (upcoming EBI 7 no gi tournament) he is actively looking for general principles that might apply to his game, thus improving himself whilst providing an excellent example to others.
