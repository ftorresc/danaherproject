Finding your pace: One of the most important factors in determining the outcome of a grappling match is the least discussed - the PACE of the match. Beyond all the techniques and tactics lies the overall pace of the two athletes. The pace will determine their work rate and if the work rate of an athlete exceed what he is physically capable of for an extended period of time, he will lapse into exhaustion. Exhaustion is almost always a precursor of defeat. Work rate is a fascinating concept. You can work in different ways. Sometimes the work will be isometric, with a demand for static holding strength for time. Other times the work will be movement, with heavy aerobic demands. Other times it will be explosive speed work. Each is tiring in a different way, and most importantly, different athletes usually excel at one type of work but not others. You can exhaust an athlete with excellent aerobic fitness by making him work hard in isometric situations such as pins. You can exhaust an athlete who has great isometric strength and endurance by engaging in a speed and movement match. Learning to keep a match in your preferred work type and away from an opponents preferred work type is a big part of winning tough matches. Know your own body. Know what kind of physical work you best engage in. Create a game and style that keeps you inside that type of work and the ability to keep an opponent there as well. This can often be as important as your skill and tactics in bringing you victory.
