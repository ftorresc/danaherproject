When your opponents goes to initiate movement youâ€™ve got two choices - either try to STOP the movement or GO WITH the movement. Both approaches are very effective - which one you choose in a given case will depend on the circumstances of that case - which one you choose in general will be determined by your body type and personality. One is not better than the other, but they do amount to very different expressions of Jiu jitsu. Garry Tonon was a master of FOLLOWING an opponents movement - Gordon Ryan was a master of STOPPING an opponents movement. Which do you generally prefer?
