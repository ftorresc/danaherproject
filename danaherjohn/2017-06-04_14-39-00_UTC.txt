Kohai taking titles: This weekend was Sapateiro 9 - the 145 pound division. Two squad apprentices (kohai) were sent, Jonathan "JC" Calestine and Ethan Crelinsten. Both men submitted all their opponents in regulation time (EBI rules in effect) to the final. It was notable that along the way they defeated EBI veterans, JM Holland via heel hook and Mike Davila by toe hold and ADCC trials standout, Ian Murray via heel hook - showing how they are getting ever closer to the next level of competition at a very young age and with very short time in training. In the final the two team mates met each other. Every day in the gym they spar and it's always a very even match - so too in the final of sapateiro 9. However, this time JC was able to catch a powerful lock to the ankle and secure a great win. He walks away with another great win, two thousand shekels and the great satisfaction of a 100% submission in regulation record - very difficult to achieve at this level - but it is our goal every time our athletes step on to the mat.
