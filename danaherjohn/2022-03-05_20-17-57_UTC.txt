I am very pleased to announce the release of my latest instructional video - NEW WAVE MOUNTED PIN ATTACKS. In this video I look in detail at no gi mounted position and show exactly how my students first control opponents, then shut down their ability to escape, then attack their ability to breath and then finish them with refined versions of the most high percentage finishes from the mounted position. Gaining confidence in the mounted position without the GI can be a tough journey. Without a collar to stabilize you and set up strangles and arm bars it can feel like riding a barrel down a river when you’re perched atop an strongly bridging and twisting opponent. Yet the potential rewards are huge. It’s no coincidence that the two greatest grapplers of all time, Roger Gracie and Gordon Ryan, both favored the mount above all other top pins. If you want to know how to get the most out of this position and use it to dominate your toughest rivals and training partners check it out! Link in my Instagram Bio
