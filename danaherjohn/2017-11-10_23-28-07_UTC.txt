Gordon Ryan vs Ralek Gracie: The squad returns its focus to submission grappling as Gordon Ryan takes on Ralek Gracie in his hometown of Torrence, California on the 26 November. The squad has faced Mr Gracie before, Garry Tonon overcame a big size difference to win via leg lock. This time the match is a no time time limit submission only match. Mr Ryan will be the same weight and height as Mr Gracie. He has boldly declared that he will limit himself to only two forms of submission - the juji garami armlock variations and sankaku (triangle) variations. Just one week after this match, Mr Ryan will take on the field at EBI 14 open weight and then the next week take on the formidable double gold world champion Yuri Simoes in a mixed submission/points event, going from California to Texas to NYC in three weeks against some of the worldâ€™s best! That is certainly a tough way to end the year. Training and preparation is under way after going in very different directions assisting Georges St-Pierre prepare for his great bout with Michael Bisping. Back in the basement of despair and knowledge again and researching.
