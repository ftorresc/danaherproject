Inside the mind of Eddie Cummings as he walks out to another match: "Coach has been watching me train every day in fight camp. He knows my game inside out. I've memorized all the complex names and code words for the moves so I can react instantly when he calls for them. He knows my game better than I know myself - I will move exactly as he calls the moves and victory will be mine..." Inside the mind of John Danaher: "Dang...I forgot this kids name again...was it Eddie Bravo? No - that's that rubbery guy from California - different guy. Ummm...Poindexter? No. Damn...maybe someone in the crowd will know...what is his game? Never can remember...wait...I think he mostly does half guard passing...yes, that's it...ok, this should be fine..."
