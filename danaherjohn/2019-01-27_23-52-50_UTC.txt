The back system - Default principle: A central principle of attacking from the back is the default principle - WHEN BEHIND AN OPPONENT, YOU MUST CONSTANTLY THREATEN STRANGULATION SO THAT IF YOUR OPPONENTS DEFENSIVE HANDS AND CHIN SHOULD EVER FALTER OR FALL OUT OF POSITION - YOU WILL BY DEFAULT, TAKE THE STRANGLE IMMEDIATELY. Following this simple principle creates a lot of stress in your opponent. Often one can get so caught up in the constant hand fighting/arm trapping battle and the struggle to maintain overall position that we completely overlook an easy opening right there in front of us to simply slip into the stranglehold when the neck is exposed. Here, stand out junior squad member Frank Rosenthal shows a fine application of the default principle at a tournament in England that he competed in over the weekend. No need to trap arms when the neck is open - just go straight in for the kill!
