What are your next two moves if this one fails? One of the great features of Jiu Jitsu is the relatively SLOW PACE in which the game operates compared with other combat sports. When a move is starting to fail - YOU CAN FEEL THE ONSET OF FAILURE before it happens. Take advantage of this fact. Make sure that you have the next two moves planned out ahead of time any time you enter into a given move. This will greatly increase your effectiveness on the mat. Itâ€™s not realistic to think too many moves out into the future - there are too many contingencies to cover for that to be realistic, but two is a a very doable and realistic number that will turn your failures into success. Start with your favorite positions and map out your best options when they fail in a particular way. I promise this will increase your win rate much faster than learning entirely new moves.
