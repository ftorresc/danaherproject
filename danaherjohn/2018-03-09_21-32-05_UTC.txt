A fun day of training today at RGA when the Hayden brothers, Josh and Jason cane in unexpectedly for a workout with the squad. They have always been among our toughest rivals in EBI competition and other shows. It’s always a pleasure to see athletes in less competitive settings and enjoy a grappling in a way that can’t be done under the pressure of the big stage. Both brothers are highly skilled in submissions and had a fine day’s work with the squad. As much as competition success is a worthy goal, friendship and civility is a more worthy one. Here the Hayden brothers listen to our horrible stories and opinions after a great session of armlocks, leg locks and strangles.
