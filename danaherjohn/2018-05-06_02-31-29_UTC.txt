Learning lessons: Gordon Ryan fought a tough match in his ACB debut against the very talented Vinny Magalhaes and lost a close points decision. Mr Magalhaes got a strong start with a nice guard pass early in the first round. Mr Ryan seemed to prevail in the closely contested action in the next two rounds with several strong leg lock attempts and off balances but could not translate it into points and so lost the decision based on the first round. All credit to Mr Magalhaes for a very good performance. For us - we will have to improve our adjustment to the new rule set and come back stronger next time. The good news is that Itâ€™s always an easier thing to fix tactics than technique - so we shall head back to the blue basement and work on that. Wishing you all the best from LA - hope you enjoyed the show! We are in the stands now watching Leandro Lo take on Gabriel Arges - so much talent on this card! Always great to see the super stars of the sport in one room and putting on a show!
