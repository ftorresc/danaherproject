On the road again: Waiting for my flight to Melbourne at Changi International Airport - looking forward to coaching at @johndonehuejj and @acsamelbourne and catching up with local Jiu Jitsu and my family ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤— Itâ€™s been a privilege to watch Garry Tononâ€™s development in MMA - itâ€™s still early days but this hard working young man is making great strides in the worlds toughest sport. It is such a joy to come out to Asia and be part of @onechampionship and see their growth as an MMA organization and teach at @evolvemma gym and see people pick up on our approach to the sport. Canâ€™t wait to return! Hope you all enjoyed the show! Make sure you tune in to @kasaigrappling for Gordon Ryan against the talented champion Matheus Diniz and up and coming juniors Ethan Crelinsten and Frank Rosenthal going in among some of the most highly ranked lightweights in the world in a tournament format! Itâ€™s going to be a great show! See you all in Melbourne! ðŸ¤—
