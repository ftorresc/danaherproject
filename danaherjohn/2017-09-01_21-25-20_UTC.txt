Comeback: Anyone who plans a long term investment in jiu jitsu will have to go through at least one big comeback before their time in the sport is over. Life has a way of taking us out of our plans and sometimes our training gets derailed. The ability to come back, get back to where you were, and then move past into a new level of development is critical if jiu jitsu is to be a lifetime activity for you. Georges St-Pierre @georgesstpierre is beginning his comeback now as a professional MMA athlete, but the very same trials he is currently going through - doubts about his ability to regain past form, to be able to present new skills beyond the old ones, the ability to keep with an ever changing sport - these are all things YOU will have to go through whenever circumstances take you out of the sport for a time. It's important to scale back the early workouts - there will always be time to go harder in the future. Gradual progress over time always trumps unsustainable surges in the long run. Here, Mr St-Pierre works on elements of our back attack system with one of the true masters of it, Gordon Ryan @gordonlovesjiujitsu Afterwards they went through some hard sparring in standing position, a skill in which Mr St-Pierre excels. It was a great example of two outstanding athletes using their domain of excellence to benefit the other, so that MUTUAL benefit - the finest and most sustainable form of benefit - can occur.
