Learn to prioritize: Sometimes it can seem like the many details and nuances that underlie the main moves of Jiu Jitsu can be a burden when it’s time to perform them in a competitive situation. As you try to remember them all it might seem they actually slow you down and become less efficient in your movement. Understand that the information has an order of priority. There are always one or two main ideas that are most responsible for the success or failure of the move and then come all the other details, usually in an order from most important to least important. For this reason it is crucial that you be able to list the three or four main details in (rough) order of importance (this will vary somewhat from one individual to another so make the list a personal one). In this way you will learn to focus on the small number of main ideas that make it work without being burdened by trying to satisfy too many demands of you afford every detail equal priority. In this way you can get information to work FOR you instead of AGAINST you - and that’s when the game becomes fun.
