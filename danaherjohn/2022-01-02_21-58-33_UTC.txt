Using gravity from underneath: One of the most common beliefs in grappling is that the top athlete always has gravity working in his favor against the bottom athlete. In fact the bottom athlete also has gravity working for him - JUST IN A DIFFERENT WAY. The top athlete gets to use gravity in his favor as a means to make an opponent CARRY HIS WEIGHT. The bottom athlete gets to use gravity in his favor by BREAKING HIS OPPONENTS BALANCE SO THAT TOP ATHLETE STUMBLES AND LOSES THE INTEGRITY OF HIS STANCE. As the bottom athlete you can use gravity just as effectively as the top player by CONSTANTLY FORCING HIS CENTER OF GRAVITY BEYOND HIS BASE OF SUPPORT. Every time you do this you will break his stance and force him to immediately focus on recovery. Do this many times over a match and you’ll exhaust even the fittest opponents. Combine it with sweeps and submissions and you’ll rack up a landslide of points and submit a lot of people. Never forget - you BOTH have gravity working in your favor. Victory will go to the athlete who uses it appropriately from whatever position you currently occupy
