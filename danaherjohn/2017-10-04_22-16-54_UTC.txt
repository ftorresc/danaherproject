Squad senpai officially loses his mind - goes on tattoo rampage in midtown Manhattan: Gordon Ryan fresh off the most successful debut performance in ADCC world championships history decided a good first move upon return would be a bucketful of new tattoos ðŸ˜³ðŸ’¥ðŸ˜³. Mr Ryanâ€™s earlier tattoos are a constant source of banter and ridicule from team mates here in the blue basement. This time he appears to have put more thought into the project and had the Indian goddess Kali, some of whose followers formed a sect based around strangulation- hmmmm....perhaps he is taking that back attack system thing too seriously! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Along with, how surprising, some King motifs ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ Whatever one thinks of the tattoos, I have to admire his dedication to the project - a marathon nine hour session to get it done quickly so he can return to training in the least time. I hope this does not set a precedent where every time he wins something he gets another giant tattoo - thereâ€™s not much room left at this point!
