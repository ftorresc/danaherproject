Strong start: The squad entered the professional grappling competition circuit in fine form today. Gordon Ryan won the Sapitiero 6 Grappling Invitational and took $10,000 first prize. Up and coming kohai student Matthew Tesla put on a great display in his first big competition, submitting everyone on his side of the bracket including 10th planet stand out Boogyman Martinez to get to the finals against team mate Mr Ryan. Mr Tesla used his superb ashi garami based leg locking skills to finish everyone he faced - Mr Ryan used exclusively upper body attacks to showcase his submission versatility and take the big prize. We have other kohai students competing in Texas - will update as facts come in. I am especially proud of this result as it represents a real breakthrough for Mr Tesla to get into top level pro sub grappling and shine. Mr Ryan has battled heroically through a mystery illness that has plagued him for months and showed incredible discipline to train through it and prevail. Great to see a strong start to 2017 - big plans, big ambitions and the discipline to make them real.
