Bound for Boston: Waiting at Penn Station in rush hour - always an experience wading through the Manhattan commuters as everyone flees work and spills out of the city for the weekend! My goal is a little different - Iâ€™m going TO work - about to completely re-do the entire leg lock instructional to overcome the audio problems and bring the production quality up to the standards of the content. Four hour train ride then two days of filming over ten hours of content/usually double that time of actual work, then four hours back to NYC Sunday night and then 6:30am start Monday finishing teaching around 10pm - should be quite a weekend! ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ Looking forward to getting everything right this time!
