Rite of passage: Nicky Ryan attained his first adult belt today. Though he is fifteen years old, his fast approaching birthday makes him eligible for an adult purple belt. Mr Ryan's ambitions include IBJJF sanctioned competition, both gi and no gi, so having a set belt rank will be important in the next few years to get him ready for ever greater challenges as he matures. His progress thus far has been extraordinary, but he has very high standards for himself and is looking to push much, much further. We are all very proud of his amazing work ethic and maturity. In attendance were his daily mentors, Garry Tonon and brother Gordon Ryan, along with our good friend and accomplice, Tom DeBlass, who has played such a fantastic role in Mr Tonon's and the Ryan Brothers development. Smiles all round as this wonderful young talent gets his well deserved reward ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
