Today Gordon Ryan and Oliver Taza locked horns with the outstanding Jake Shields and Mathew Tesla among others to test in live sparring the techniques and strategies the squad develops for the big shows. The competitors list for EBI 11 welterweight event is very impressive indeed - getting ready for the intensity of top level grappling whilst maintaining athlete safety in the final days is always a delicate balancing act. Professionalism and prioritizing the show over the gym is the key to getting it right.
