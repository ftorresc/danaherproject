Big night for the squad in LA at EBI 7: Eddie Cummings wins again - every match by submission in regulation time to win the maximum possible prize money of $20,000. Mr Cummings was able to extend his submission range in this event and incorporate elements of our back attack system which proved so effective for Gordon Ryan in the previous EBI. This system will, I have no doubt, prove as game changing as our leg lock system. It gave  his performance a well rounded look featuring both Le g locks and strangles and exploded the myth that his game is one dimensional. His game simply looked several levels above his competitors and shows how he is continuing to make technical progress at a rapid rate. Interestingly the other competitors seem to be following our lead in submission grappling style, but lacked the nuances to make it work. Now we will go on to tomorrow where Garry Tonon will square off with Ralek Gracie in what will be a fascinating contrast in styles along with a big size advantage to Mr Gracie. Thank you as always for your interest in the exploits of the squad and our attempts to change the sport of submission grappling.
