First negate - then attack: Some of the most exhausting and frustrating sessions we have are those where you go against an evenly matched opponent and you both relentlessly attack each other move for move. This is certainly exciting and fun, but often does not get us the kind of replicable results we are looking for. ATTACKING WHILE BEING ATTACKED is not really the ideal - itâ€™s not wrong and it can work on occasion, but in the majority of cases you will better exemplify the spirit of Jiu Jitsu - control leading to submission - by first NEGATING YOUR OPPONENTS ABILITY TO ATTACK YOU and only then ATTACKING YOUR OPPONENT. When you have first shut down the other fellows offense - you can focus much better own your own offense.
