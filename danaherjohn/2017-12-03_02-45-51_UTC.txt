Training in Texas: The squad arrived in Austin, Texas and straight to workout room. Here we are in The Center for Veterans Of Foreign Wars - Post 8787 - Veterans Jiu Jitsu. It’s great to see a community center dedicated to Veterans of America’s armed forces and an honor to work out there. Here, Garry Tonon and Gordon Ryan go through their submissions drills before EBI 14 tomorrow night and then afterwards Mr Tonon went through his MMA drills. Texas has its own unique charm. Now it’s back to the hotel to rest and hopefully watch a very exciting looking UFC card tonight. Wishing you all the best from Texas!
