When you have one - you have the other: There are certain submissions where if you have that submission, you always have easy access to another submission. So for example, if you have an inside heel hook, you almost always have easy access to an outside heel hook (among other options). One of the most important examples of this is the relationship between ARM BAR (juji gatame) and TRIANGLE (sankaku). It is almost always the case that if you have one, you can easily switch to the other. Itâ€™s important that you are always cognizant of this because there will be many times that a simple and prompt switch from one to the other will be necessary to finish a strongly resisting opponent. Interestingly these two options often have a symbiotic relationship - the more an opponent resists one, the easier it becomes to apply the other, so that the threat of one aids the application of the other. We all have a tendency to get locked into tunnel vision when focusing hard on a move - knowing ahead of time that certain moves are closely linked to others and that you always have that second option is a good way to restore the vision you need to see the full range of opportunities in front of you
