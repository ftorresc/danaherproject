Victory: Gordon Ryan relaxes after a titanic no time limit match against the great Keenan Cornelius. After an epic one and a half hour struggle of tactics and endurance, Mr Ryan prevailed via heel hook variation. Both men showed tremendous skill and tactical sense, but Mr Ryan was coming off a tremendous camp and preparation and his morale was high. After several near misses, he saw opportunity on the legs and took it to victory. Mr Cornelius showed great character in taking this fight, as he is an established superstar in the sport - to take a no time limit match against a youngster like Mr Ryan was a very commendable action on his part. Now the squad must resume training in preparation for EBI 8 and other future endeavors @jeffreyschu
