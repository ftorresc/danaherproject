Superb win for Craig Jones! International student extraordinaire Craig Jones won a beautiful submission victory over the very talented Polish grappling super star Adam Wardzinski with a flawless Kimura into side triangle (yoko sankaku) combination attack in Liverpool England. Mr Wardzinski has a very strong butterfly guard game, but Mr Jones bypassed that with a rolling kimura attack and capitalized upon his opponents defensive turn to seize a side triangle and take a good situation into a great situation. A second defensive turn created an inverted variation of the same side triangle that only served to make it tighter and the win was complete. Great work again by Mr Jones as he shows his ever increasing submission repertoire against some of the best Jiu Jitsu players in the world!
