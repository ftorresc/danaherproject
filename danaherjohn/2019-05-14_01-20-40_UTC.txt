I am so proud of this young man: Here in Singapore at the @evolvemma Squad Super Seminar young Nicky Ryan, just seventeen years old teaching a masterclass on his favorite aspect of Jiu Jitsu- back control and finishes - to an audience of over one hundred international Jiu Jitsu enthusiasts at one of the best gyms in the world. Itâ€™s incredible to watch someone so young display such artistry and teach so commandingly. He will soon be releasing a video on Back Mastery for @bjj.fanatics and judging by the awed reactions to his teaching here in Singapore he will make it one of the very best ever made - amazing to watch this lesson unfold!
