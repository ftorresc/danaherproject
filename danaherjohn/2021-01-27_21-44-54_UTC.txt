Breaking stance and posture: Most Jiu jitsu students are made aware of the critical importance of stance and posture early in their training. You soon learn that breaking an opponents stance and posture pays big dividends in sparring. Perhaps the most impressive example of this is the one used the least - breaking an opponents stance and posture while attacking him with a submission hold. It’s bad enough to get caught in a tight submission hold - it’s TWICE as bad to get caught in a tight submission and then get your stance and posture broken down so that you cannot even defend yourself properly. Remember that submission defense almost always requires some kind of defensive posture - if you lose that then the hold becomes practically indefensible. Next time you are attacking a submission hold - GO THE EXTRA DISTANCE AND LOOK TO BREAK THE OPPONENTS STANCE AND POSTURE AS WELL - you will soon find far fewer opponents are escaping your favorite holds
