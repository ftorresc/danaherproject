Fun day of training today with the squad: It was great having guests @felipepenabjj @romulobarral and @marcusbuchecha and @craigjonesbjj joining up with myself, @gordonlovesjiujitsu and the squad juniors in a packed class in the blue basement today. Everyone is getting ready for the big show at @kasaigrappling this weekend featuring some of the worlds greatest grappling talent. Everyone looked in tremendous form - this show has the potential to be one of the very best ever. It was a pleasure to share technique with these gentlemen and some laughs to. Keep your eyes on Kasai grappling this weekend and see the best in our beloved sport!
