This is the day Garry Tonon was confirmed to fight the very talented and dangerous Rousimar Palhares: I am trying to ask him if he really wants this fight despite the obvious size and strength disadvantage. The smile on his face tells you not only the answer, but also just how fearless and confident this young prodigy is. Famously he went on to dominate all the leg lock exchanges in a great match against the man widely considered to the best and most fearsome leg locker in professional fighting.
