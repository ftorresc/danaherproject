Rainy Sunday afternoon: Grey day in Manhattan - perfect for a day of technical training with the squad. Georges St-Pierre and the team go over details and concepts at a pace that allows for skill progression and helps to avoid athlete burn out, a common problem for people competing many times a year. Ethan Crelinsten shows great work ethic by coming in for training the day after winning the 135 pound division of Finishers Sub Only event, where he used a combination of leg locks and back control to take first place. Tomorrow the weekly cycle of training begins anew with different intensity level and emphasis.
