Filming the upcoming open guard video with BJJ Fanatics here in Boston!! Getting a solid five days of filming here in Boston for upcoming videos - it’s always a pleasure to come up to New England and work. It’s a beautiful train ride up and filming the videos is always a great way to get our approach bro the game out there to a wider audience. Always my belief was that knowledge translated into skill is the single most important determinant of the outcome of a match, more than strength, size, speed mental toughness etc (these other things are still very important but not as much as knowledge/skill). The videos are a great way to get that knowledge to a wider audience in a way that will give people insight into a rapidly changing game. Wishing you all the best from Boston!!
