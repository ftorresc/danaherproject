What are the broad movements required for its execution? Sketch the outline first - THE DETAILS CAN ALWAYS COME LATER. Just get them moving in the general directions they need. Just as an artist begins with a sketch and only then brings in the complexity of colors fill the canvas and create a masterpiece over time, so too, The martial artist must begin with the rough outline of the move and over time ADD DETAILS AS A PAINTER ADDS COLOR TO COMPLETE A PICTURE. In all technique development , start with general movement and over time refine it with precise movement. Donâ€™t be obsessed with precision at the start - that will come later. Here I work with talented youth athletes Liam Zeh and Trinity Pun on back system details - they already have excellent performance with the general movements so the process of refinement now begins...
