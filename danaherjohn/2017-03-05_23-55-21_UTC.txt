My original competing Grappling student, Eddie Cummings, will be teaching a seminar at Musclepharm headquarters in Denver Colorado. Mr Cummings has spent the most time of all my competing students in private classes with me. He has an unparalleled knowledge of my leg lock system. Unfortunately his incredible success with leg locks in top level level competition has blinded most people to his skills in upper body submissions. In this sense he is something of a victim of his own success! He also has a very strong positional game with excellent guard retention and passing skills. Mr Cummings, like all my best students, is an extremely inventive fellow who has gone beyond my teachings and has many very effective variations of his favorite skills and positions that are uniquely his own. On top of all this, his background in academia makes him a truly fine teacher - he can really take his knowledge and make it accessible to you. If you can make it to Denver Colorado, take the time to learn from this man - you will get a deep insight into the squads philosophy, tactics and methods. New York City style in Denver - you will love it! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
