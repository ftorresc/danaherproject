Every submission hold has its own character: we are involved in a sport where the submission hold is the pinnacle of techniques- the very soul of the sport. Accordingly, deep study of the main families of submissions is essential to your progress. Each lock and strangle has its own unique character and applicability- that is why it is common to see athletes who are very strong in some, yet weak in others. One could easily spend a lifetime of study on just five families of submissions and still not come close to the limit of what is possible. Typically athletes will develop a special affinity for four of five submissions, plus several more as back up in case of emergency. Depth of knowledge counts for more than breadth of knowledge in submissions and indeed, in most elements of jiu jitsu. Here Benson Henderson works on a variation of the Achilles lock with the squad. Drilling like this provides a great opportunity to deepen your understanding of the correct mechanics underlying the lock that will make the move work in the pressure of competition
