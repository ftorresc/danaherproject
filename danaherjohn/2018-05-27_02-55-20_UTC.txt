Great day of filming back attack system in Boston: I returned to Boston today to reshoot the BACK ATTACKS: ENTER THE SYSTEM video instructional (another part of the ENTER THE SYSTEM series detailing the systems based approach to jiu jitsu that I teach to my students). The original filming suffered from the same audio issues as the original leg lock video so there was only one thing to do - start over again and do it right. Filming at Bernardo Faria’s academy in Boston all day today - just finished day one at 10pm and begin day two tomorrow at 8am. Can’t wait to show our approach to finishing from the back and change the game! Wishing you all the best from Boston and a happy Memorial weekend to all of you!
