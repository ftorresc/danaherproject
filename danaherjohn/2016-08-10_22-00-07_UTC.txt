One great deed begets another: I am always impressed by the way in which an outstanding deed by one student can serve as a catalyst to the other students and lift their performance. Inspired by the incredible performance of teammate Travis Stevens in taking a silver medal in the Olympics yesterday, the training room was alive with standout performances today. There really is wisdom to the old idea that people feed off their surroundings- when we surround ourselves with outstanding people, each one lifts the next in a chain reaction that can produce something truly great - this may be an individual sport in competition, but in training it is a team that makes the difference. Finding the balance between our own individual ambitions and those of the people around us is the key to longevity in the sport and success within it.
