Memory: The great challenge of Jiu jitsu learning is not how much you can learn - it is HOW MUCH YOU CAN RECALL UNDER STRESS. That is what matters. As such, memory and retention is among the most important factors in your progress. Everyone learns and remembers differently. Some learn and retain best with WRITING - that was always my favorite method; others never write a thing and have other methods, repetition, a seminal imprinting experience that burns the knowledge into their memory - whatever works for you. If you ARE the type that favors writing as a memory aid, you don’t need to write everything you practiced down in excruciating detail every day. Just note the main ideas that were new in bullet point form. If it’s a move that you learned, just write the two or three most important elements in order of importance. If it’s a concept, describe it’s value and main applications that apply to you. Even if you never read those notes again in your life, the mere act of focus and writing has a good clarifying effect on your thinking that will carry over into your grappling and overall thinking about the game. If you are ever injured and off the mats for a time, try writing as a temporary substitute for mat time and see how much you can recall and how clearly you can expound it. You might be surprised at how it helps you when you return
