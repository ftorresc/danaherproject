When you go to finish a submission - in the majority of cases it’s not a fight against the CLOCK - it’s a a fight against MOVEMENT. When we get into a potential finishing position there is a natural tendency among all of use to think that TIME will be the determining factor behind success or failure - the faster we do it the less chance an opponent can defend. In fact, the only case where you must race against time is when there is a set time limit and time is close to expiring. In all other cases, your prime concern should not be time, but rather, RESTRICTING MOVEMENT. It is MOVEMENT that will enable to get an opponent out of the move. Set your mind to focus upon control over movement, rather than speed of execution. Slow things down rather than speed things up and soon you will be exhibiting the kind of control necessary to finish high level opponents
