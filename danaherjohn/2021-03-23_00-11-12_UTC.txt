When you’re the more experienced or bigger partner - start in bottom position with disadvantage: We all have a wide variety of training partners. Inevitably there will be big variations in size and skill level among them - so don’t treat them all the same. When you are more experienced or bigger - don’t start neutral as you would for someone your own size or skill level - start with some form of disadvantage so you get more out of the session and work skills you might not otherwise work and at the same time make it more competitive. When you do this you can be in a room full of small white belts and still get a good workout. It’s not about who you beat in the gym - it’s about beating who you were yesterday - and starting with disadvantage is the best way to do this when training with people you already know you can easily beat.
