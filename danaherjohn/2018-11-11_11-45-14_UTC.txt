Jiu Jitsu in Melbourne: Had a blast teaching at my friend John Donahueâ€™s awesome gym @johndonehuejj here in Melbourne and then dinner with my family afterwards- it doesnâ€™t get any better than that ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š Always great to get home and see the sport growing! Tomorrow I teach a different topic at @acsamelbourne Nemesis MMA - hope I can help the local talent go further! Looking forward to seeing you on the mats!
