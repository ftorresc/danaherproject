Levels of intensity: One of the best features of jiu jitsu as a martial arts is the degree to which it allows practitioners to adjust the intensity of the moves to the situation in which they find themselves. This allows for choice in our application of the art - it can range from very mild to very severe, depending upon the context. Probably the single best way to assess the skill level of a jiu jitsu player is to look at their ability to play with the full range of intensity, from low to high against high level opponents in competitive situations. When you see someone effortlessly controlling a fully resisting opponent, that is a very clear sign of technical excellence. Winning is one thing, but HOW you win is always the deeper story of your skill level. This weekend, up and coming apprentice (kohai) student, Stanley Rosa, showed his rapidly improving technique through superb control. Mr Rosa is a student of my great friend, Doug Pelinkovic at RGA Bronx @bxmartialarts and often trains with the squad and in addition, I teach there once a week. The Bronx bombers have been training hard. Mr Rosa traveled to Tulsa Oklahoma to compete in Sub Wars submission only event for one thousand six hundred shekels. Fighting through a round robin event, he defeated all opponents via submission. In the final he showed excellent control in the application of juji gatame- the arm bar - to win first place. Like all the best submission holds, juji has two aspects - the control/pin aspect and the breaking/submission aspect. THE BEST PEOPLE EXCEL AT BOTH AND UNDERSTAND THAT ANY DEFICIENCIES WITH ONE MAKE FAILURE WITH THE OTHER VERY LIKELY.
