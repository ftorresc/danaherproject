Sometimes when you win...you lose: Garry Tonon came back to the gym immediately for training after his victory in Polaris Grappling over the weekend - an admirable action to be sure. He had tired of his blonde frosted haircut meant to parody his rival Dillon Danis and tried to dye his hair black - unfortunately his hair dying skills do not match his grappling skills and today he showed up with blue hair!! Nice work champ ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ #youmayhavewonthebattlebutdillonwonthewar
