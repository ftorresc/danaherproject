What’s your mindset here? You’re under attack. A stud opponent has your leg in a vulnerable position and is working intelligently and swiftly towards a finish. How is your mind reacting? The lowest level of reaction is PANIC. The second level of reaction is to scramble into intelligently directed defense and ESCAPE. The third and highest level of reaction is to see the possible of COUNTERATTACK even as you navigate into an escape. TO SEE THE POSSIBILITY OF DEVASTATING COUNTER OFFENSE WHEN EVERYONE ELSE SEES ONLY DEFENSE IS THE MARK OF A SUPERIOR SUBMISSION EXPERT. Train your mind to think this way and you will distinguish yourself from the crowd
