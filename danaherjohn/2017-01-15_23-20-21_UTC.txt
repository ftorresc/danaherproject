The Artist's medium: Every art uses a medium through which the artist may achieve self expression.  The degree to which he or she succeeds or fails is largely bound up with his or her depth of understanding of that medium. If a painter has only a poor knowledge of paint, color, tone, intensity, perspective, brushwork and canvas; it is unlikely that deep self expression will arise from shallow knowledge of the very medium that makes that expression possible. In the empty handed martial arts, the HUMAN BODY is the medium through which the artist must express himself. Like any other artist, the deeper the knowledge of the medium, the better will be the opportunity for impressive self expression. Not only is knowledge of the working of the human body important here, but so to is your ability to maximize your use of the human body. If you are limited in your ability to move your body, this will always make self expression through the body more difficult. Thus the constant need to maintain and improve the dexterity, strength and overall health of your body to the greatest degree possible. This the martial artist shares in common with all those artists who express themselves through the body - gymnasts, dancers, athletes of every type. With all other artists they share the need for a medium and for the deep study of that medium if their work is to be impressive. Their only difference from these other artists is the direction they choose to express themselves - but like all their brethren, the best among them study and cherish the medium with which they work.
