Reflections on my sensei: Cross training When I first began jiu jitsu in the early to mid 1990's, the overall ethos of the martial arts scene was very different. This was a time of style versus style in MMA (as opposed to the modern spirit of well rounded athlete vs well rounded athlete). This was a time of proving a new martial art BJJ, among the more established traditional martial arts and sports. As such, most jiu jitsu practitioners took on an "us vs them" mentality that was necessary at the time if jiu jitsu was to show it was a viable art that could stand on its own merits and be counted among the foremost fighting arts. One of the great insights of my sensei Renzo Gracie, was that this attitude, whilst necessary in the beginning, was limiting in the long term. Accordingly he strongly encouraged all his students to engage in the study of other arts, especially those with a competition sports aspect, such as boxing, Muay Thai, wrestling, judo, sambo etc. I can say of my sensei that HE WAS INTENSELY PROUD OF JIU JITSU AND HIS LINEAGE WITHIN IT, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, ENDLESSLY CURIOUS ABOUT OTHER COMBAT SPORTS AND HOW THEY COULD BE DRAWN UPON TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE IN JIUJITSU. This insistence upon some degree of cross training was I believe, one of the many reasons why Mr Gracie was able to keep a very modern and cutting edge vibe to his school and his teachings after more than twenty years here in the USA. I have seen so many students profit from some degree of cross training, some more, some less - but I have NEVER seen a student get worse from it. Nowadays cross training is the norm, with most jiu jitsu athletes happy to work wrestling and judo and other arts into their program. Whenever you find yourself stagnating or in some form of jiu jitsu plateau - take heed of my sensei's example and find inspiration and new directions in another art - it will only make your jiu jitsu stronger.
