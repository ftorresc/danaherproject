What a performance! There were quite a few outstanding performances among the many athletes at the recent west coast ADCC trials in California. One of the standouts was that of fifteen year old Nicky Ryan who competed brilliantly against very tough adult competition. Mr Ryan won every match he entered by submission except that against his team mate, Ethan Crelinsten, which he narrowly lost on points. Then he came back and win the last match for bronze medal by submission. It was not just the fact that he was submitting people - it was the manner in which he did it - excellent smooth entries, combination attacks into tight locks that showed early mastery of the game of control leading to submission. He he uses elements of our sankaku (triangle) system to get an impressive win. Sankaku is one of Mr Ryan's favorite finishes and you can see here he excels at it.
