Australian tour: After teaching the Singapore super seminar @evolvemma November 5-10 and cornering Garry Tonon for his third fight at @onechampionship MMA, I will go to see family and friends in Australia - hopefully avoiding local wildlife. I am delighted to be able to join my old friend and Aussie Jiu Jitsu icon John Donahue in Melbourne on November 11 Sunday at 2-5pm @johndonehuejj for back system and Nemesis MMA @acsamelbourne Monday night for leg system. Then itâ€™s off to Sydney to see my dear Mom (Mum) and then teach a super seminar at @kmasalievski KMA martial arts - they have just announced another session as the first two day session was sold out - check with them to get in the next session if you missed out or feel like extra ğŸ˜œ In between I shall join old friends at @vt1martialarts with Liam Resnekov and do what I can for local Jiu Jitsu scene. Canâ€™t wait to see you all and catch up with Australiaâ€™s incredible growth in Jiu Jitsu! In the meantime I will get The squad ready and practice crocodile wrestling, snake catching, shark nose punching and kangaroo kick counters to ensure my safety while there ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ See you all soon! ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡º PS One day Iâ€™m going to have the time to get to New Zealand I promise!
