Gordon Ryan taking on the big men: Next weekend in Dallas Texas, Gordon Ryan will step back on to the big stage in Dallas Texas at @kasaigrappling championships to take on the very powerful and distinguished  Ultra heavyweight Jo√£o Gabriel Rocha - ADCC silver medalist and long time rival of the great Marcus Buchecha Almeida. Mr Rocha will have a forty pound weight advantage - he is a very impressive performer on the competition circuit - he went a grueling twenty five minutes with Buchecha in his last big outing at ACB and lost a close decision. This will be a very tough test indeed and creates a classic contest between the smaller grappler with strong submission skills versus the bigger grappler with excellent positional skills. As Always, Mr Ryan has been training hard in preparation - looking forward to another Kasai show - they are doing a fantastic job of being the best athletes in the sport together in an exciting format and display. We are looking forward to this clash of styles against such a great opponent!
