Excited to see Gordon Ryan back in action in two different capacities next week. He competes in the Fight2Win promotion (more on that soon) and then teaches a seminar at Musclepharm gym. The interplay between competing and coaching is a fascinating one in jiu jitsu. I am a believer in the idea that teaching always helps development of the teacher as much as the student. The level of my own game rose dramatically when I started teaching full time. Mr Ryan, like all my best students, is a very fine teacher. He has many improvements and advancements of the philosophy that our team utilizes. For our friends in Colorado- this is a great chance to learn from a passionate student of the game who has a great deal of truly interesting knowledge to offer that can kickstart a jump in your level and perhaps change the way you think about the sport. If you can get there - don't miss it! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
