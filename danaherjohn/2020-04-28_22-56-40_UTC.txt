Gordon Ryan learns the art of tactics: Every Sunday (before this whole Coronavirus thing kicked in) Gordon and the squad come in to do a private class. We discuss a topic and get to practicing/sparring. One day Gordon was asking questions about match tactics. Usually he doesnâ€™t bother with tactics at all - he just goes out on stage with the intention of controlling and submitting his opponent come what may - but as you can see - Mr Ryan may well be a true young master of control and submission - but he is a straight up white belt when it comes to devious tactics!!
