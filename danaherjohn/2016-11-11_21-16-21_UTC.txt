All American Brian Stann trains with the squad: It is always a pleasure to meet the many visitors who come to the fine city of New York and make the journey down to the basement of learning. None were a greater pleasure to meet than former UFC standout, Brian Stann, who is in town for UFC 205 where he will provide color commentary in his field of expertise. This man is so much more than just another athlete. He is a former Marine in our armed forces and today runs a charity dedicated to helping former servicemen and women find employment after national service. Talking to him you get a strong insight into his sense of civic duty. He is truly a gentleman warrior who finds that balance of the true martial artist between strength  and kindness. It is a humbling experience to meet such a gentleman. We taught him submissions, but I think he taught us something much greater. Of course grappling for MMA is very different from pure submission grappling, but Mr Stann fearlessly went in and got his hands dirty with some of the latest techniques and strategies of submission grappling - a real mensch of the sport. The squad is hard at work preparing for the ADCC trials, refining old skills and adding new ones. Look for Eddie Cummings to come roaring back into the spotlight as he prepares for both ADCC and EBI 10 in rapid succession- he is training in an outstanding fashion for both rule sets ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
