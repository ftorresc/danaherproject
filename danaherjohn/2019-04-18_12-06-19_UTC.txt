Counting down to the super seminar in Singapore!! The squad is always looking forward to the next big project and coming up soon we have a triple challenge! @garrytonon will compete again in @onechampionship in his fifth MMA fight - a very quick turnaround from his flawless victory just a month ago in Japan. Then @nickyryanbjj takes on the great Uriah Faber in a grappling match in London’s week later. In between that the squad, myself, @garrytonon @gordonlovesjiujitsu and @nickyryanbjj will teach the biggest super seminar of the year at @evolvemma in Far East Square Singapore over five days, twice a day! This is going to be great!! We are plotting out our teaching and training schedule and really looking forward to this!! The energy and synergism of a multi teacher event is always something special and the location in the center of Asia adds something special to the whole event. Can’t wait to see you there!! #knowmorewinmore
