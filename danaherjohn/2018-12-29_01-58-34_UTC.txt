Jacket required: Working our way through the first sessions filming the upcoming fundamentals of Jiu Jitsu series that will be released after the completion of the ENTER THE SYSTEM series. The intention is give athletes a deep conceptual and technical understanding of the foundational elements of the sport in the traditional gi. The emphasis will be on strong positional skills and strangulation using the jacket. Loving the content so far and having a blast! The fundamentals are the heart and soul of Jiu Jitsu and my favorite thing to teach and train. We go back into action tomorrow! Wishing you all the best from Boston!! ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—
