At the end of the day none of us are special. Most of our best achievements in life come from doing the little things well for extended periods of time. Stay grounded in the belief that above all, the ACQUISITION OF SKILLS is the single most reliable avenue to human greatness; and acknowledge that whatever achievements you have so far can be quickly eroded by straying away from this fact. Stay grounded with the little things every day and know that observance of these over time will prepare you for the big things that fate will occasionally place before you and for which you will be remembered.
