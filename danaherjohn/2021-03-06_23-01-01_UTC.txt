Working the sidelines: The best place to train in the room is of course, out on the mat. However, life has a way of taking us off the mat, injury for example. When this happens the next best place is the sideline - training your mind. When most people sit on the sideline and watch it’s for the purpose of ENTERTAINMENT. That’s fine, but you can do much better than that - watch for the purpose of gaining KNOWLEDGE. When you watch, imagine yourself as one of the people on the mat. Try to give better responses to the second by second action than the person you observe. What is he doing? What would you do better? Why is your recommended course of action better than his? Done this way you become an active MENTAL participant in their PHYSICAL struggle. Doing this will make your mental game very sharp and make the task of coming back to the physical game much easier
