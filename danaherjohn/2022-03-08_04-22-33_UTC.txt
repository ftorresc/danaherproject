Counting down: Garry Tonon @garrytonon will face by far his biggest challenge this week here in Singapore as he takes on @onechampionship 155 pound champion Thanh Le @thanhlemma for the World Title. Mr Tonon has gotten to his title fight after only six bouts and losing a year and a half to Covid interruption. Mr Le brings Olympic level Tae Keon Do skills merged with MMA training with double the number of fights Mr Tonon has been in and much longer in the fight game. He can kick with either leg in any direction, and in addition has developed powerful knee strikes both in the clinch and as a weapon in the open against grapplers who try to take him down. He has sniper like accuracy with both hands and once he hurts an opponent he swarms on the them relentlessly to get powerful finishes. This is one of the those match ups where both men are very dangerous to each other but in totally different ways. What Mr Tonon lacks in experience he makes up for with dangerous submissions game and ability to scramble from anywhere to advantage. This should be a fascinating match between two great athletes who have been matched together for over a year but for whom unforeseen delays and impediments kept delaying the bout - until now. Both men are in top shape and well prepared in their own way - hope you all enjoy the show!
