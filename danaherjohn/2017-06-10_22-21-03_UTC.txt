On the road again: Apprentice (kohai) jiu jitsu athletes Nicky Ryan and Ethan Crelinsten went on the road again - traveling down to North Carolina to enter the Toro cup against tough local competition -
Both emerged victorious via submission. Here, Mr Ryan works hard to secure the vital control of upper body grips whilst maintaining lower body control - never an easy thing against a determined opponent trying his best to break free from both. His composure and knowledge of what he has to do in order to get the job done shows as he takes his time and locks in another devastating hold for the win. Tomorrow the two kohai put their teaching prowess on display - They will cover the techniques and tactics that make victories like like this routine for them. Sunday at 11am at Elevate MMA academy in North Carolina Video by dirtywhitebelt
