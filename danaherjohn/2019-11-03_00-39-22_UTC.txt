Victory in NYC!! Katelyn Chookagian won a unanimous decision with a spirited bout mostly fought in standing position where she took the first two rounds and kept her status as number one contender in her division here at UFC 244. Late in the third round she got a chance to show her developing ground skills with a nice ashi garami entrance starting from bottom half guard that forced a defensive reaction into an escape as time ran out. An excellent reward for a great camp between RGA in New York and Mark Henry in New Jersey. It was a pleasure working with Mark Henry and PJ McMahon in the corner and watching this talented young athlete duke it out here at the greatest fight palace of them all - Madison Square Garden in NYC! Hope you all enjoyed the show!! Lots more great fights going on tonight! The garden has a great atmosphere tonight - so much epic history of combat sports here - itâ€™s wonderful to see MMA entrenched now as the leader among those combat sports!
