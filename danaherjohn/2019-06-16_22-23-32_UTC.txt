I learned this one from Captain F**king Kirk...Just wrapped up an awesome weekend in Boston filming with Bernardo Faria and the team from @bjj.fanatics for an upcoming video as part of the BJJ FUNDAMENTALS: GO FURTHER FASTER series. Today we filmed positional attacks from various guard situations. Among the most useful and instructive are sweeps derived from the beautiful Tomoe - Nage throw. Once your opponentâ€™s feet and hands leave the ground very few people will be able to stop you dropping them wherever you feel like - once you lift a man - you own him and where and how hard he lands is up to you. Tomoe nage is a fine example of a lifting sweep that is equally effective down on the mat and on your feet. On the bus now heading back in the rain five hours to New York City - quite a collection of characters on the bus ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ smells like a 10th Planet seminar in here! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‰ Not sure if you can get high from passive inhalation but I think Iâ€™m about to find out ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Hopefully Iâ€™ll be sober for teaching duty tomorrow in the basement! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Happy Fatherâ€™s Day to all of you!
