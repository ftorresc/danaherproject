Hey gang! We’re heading home! At Bangkok’s international airport waiting for our twenty hour flight home with Nicky Ryan who must now get home to train in preparation for his super bout with the outstanding Geo Martinez in just less than three weeks,
along with his proud Dad. Mr Tonon will stay in Bangkok a few days to enjoy a well deserved rest after a very arduous camp. I am planning on getting back to NYC Monday morning and going straight to RGA to teach the Monday afternoon class and then the Bronx bombers at night. Let’s get the blue basement cracking like electricity and build the heat that forges champions! Barring any airport delays I will be there and need you all to turn that spark into a flame - many competitions coming up and victory goes to those who work hard and smart. See you all in the dungeon ☠️☠️☠️
