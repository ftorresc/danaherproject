It’s a game of posture: Good Jiu jitsu players always feel very difficult to attack for a simple reason - they are almost always in good posture and have the discipline to maintain that good posture through an entire match. Your job in Jiu jitsu always comes down to this simple edict: Maintain your own posture at all times whilst doing your utmost to break your opponents posture. Who wins and who loses in a tightly contested match will usually be decided by who did a better job of maintaining their own posture while undermine that of their opponent. Next time you feel stymied in your attacks against a tough opponent - start your attacks with an attack on his POSTURE and THEN the actual attack itself. I promise you this will garner you better results. Every position in Jiu jitsu has a posture appropriately it - once you know each posture and can correlate it the  positions in which it is needed, then it’s a matter of maintaining yours while breaking his - that is the essence of the entire game
