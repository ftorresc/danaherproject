Technique above all: Nicky Ryan at age 15 wins the adult advanced open weight division of Grappling Industries event showing a very finely developed leg lock game along with sound positional work. He closed out the first place with team mate Chris who also showed excellent submission skills via leg lock and sankaku. It is remarkable to see such a young man do so well against skilled adults. The photo shows how small he is compared with adults. And at 15 years old, he is not even close to adult strength levels yet. The ease and relaxed demeanor he shows when competing against grown men of high skill level bodes very well for this very talented young man.
