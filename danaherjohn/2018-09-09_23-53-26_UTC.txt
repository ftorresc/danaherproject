Big weekend of filming in Boston: I had a great weekend filming another installment of the ENTER THE SYSTEM series with BJJ Fanatics. This time it was KIMURA ATTACKS. Joining me was the great world champion Bernardo Faria @bernardofariabjj @bjj.fanatics who has recently completed his own video on one of his specialties- no gi pressure passing which should be released soon. Always a pleasure to head up to Beantown and show our approach to the sport. Kimura is such an incredibly versatile move. It functions equally well as a submission hold and as a restraining hold that sets up other forms of attack. My students have long used it as a gateway to other systems as well as a devastating attack in itself. Now itâ€™s back on the train to NYC in time to teach tomorrow and help get everyone ready for upcoming competitions! Hope you all had a great weekend - wishing you all the best!! ðŸ¤—
