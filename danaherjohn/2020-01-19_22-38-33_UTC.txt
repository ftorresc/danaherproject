Figure out where the threat is coming from and position your defense accordingly: you only have so many resources available for defense - so itâ€™s important to use them wisely. You must learn to make on the spot assessments of where the next threat will come from based upon your opponents current positioning. Here, Garry Tonon has taken a good attacking position behind Georges St Pierre. Normally if someone is out to your right hand side, the LEFT hand is your primary defensive hand to strangles and head control as it is well positioned to intercept your opponents dangerous right hand. However, in this case Mr Tonon has cunningly taken his right hand to the far side of Mr St Pierres neck - the new emerging threat is thus the front headlock/guillotine - a move that Mr Tonon excels in. With equal cunning Mr St Pierre has put up the RIGHT hand as his primary defensive hand to stop this new threat. Being observant of the encroaching threat and placing your defensive resources accordingly is a big part of what makes you a defensively sound grappler. Take the take to observe where the threat is coming from at the start and the amount of effort you will have to expend to take care of the threat will be greatly reduced!
