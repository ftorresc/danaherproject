Whenever I am in Sydney Australia I always love to see the crew at VT-1 martial arts and catch up! This week I enjoyed teaching group classes and private classes - they have windows and sun light!! I had to run downstairs to to the basement periodically to remind myself of home ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ These guys are awesome and do a fine job of building local talent and growing the sport in positive ways!
