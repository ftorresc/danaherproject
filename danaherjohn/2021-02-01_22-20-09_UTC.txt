Guard position -The cycle of push and pull: In most cases the basic cycle of guard position is PUSH FIR DEFENSE - PULL FOR OFFENSE. In the majority of cases ( there are obvious exceptions) this holds true. Whenever some is close to passing our guard our first reaction is to PUSH and create space to recover our feet and knees. Whenever we want to bring an opponent forward into submissions or sweeps in a forward direction we PULL (pushing sweeps to the rear are the exception). Learning to cycle between pushing and pulling - offense and defense - is one of the fundamental skills of the sport. Your feet and knees, hands and elbows will be your primary pushers and pullers. Learning to use them in a team in opposing directions based upon what is unfolding second by second in a match will be one of your greatest areas of study. The switch from defense to offense back to defense happens very quickly and the better you and your opponents get, the faster it will have to be.
