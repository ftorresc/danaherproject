Happy New Year from NYC!! I wanted to wish you all the best for 2020 ðŸ¤—ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œðŸ¤— It has been an amazing year with the squad having the most successful performance in ADCC history and Gordon Ryan, Garry Tonon, Nicky Rod and Craig Jones releasing more instructional videos to show how their way of playing the game can become part of your training and push you towards the same game changing methods they employ so successfully on the big stage. We all have three duties in Jiu Jitsu - to make ourselves better, to make the people who train around us better and to make the sport itself better. I hope 2020 allows you to do just that! I hope you all have a crazy fun New Years Eve with lots of wild stories to tell on New Yearâ€™s Day ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œand make 2020 your beat year of progress and growth in all the aspects of life that you care about ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤— Have fun and train hard!
