Controlled but dangerous: There is a huge difference between a match where you find yourself against an opponent from whom you feel no danger versus one where you feel the opponent can hurt you at any moment. In the first case there is a light hearted feel to the match, in the second case you will feel significant stress. More significantly you will take FAR LESS RISK when matched against a dangerous opponent and play with a safety first attitude that will inhibit your game a little. The point is this - WHEN PLAYING A DANGEROUS OPPONENT YOU WILL PLAY A VERY DIFFERENT GAME THAN WHEN FACING AN OPPONENT FOR WHOM YOU FEEL NO FEAR. Make yourself dangerous and opponents will play a very respectful game against you. When I say dangerous I do NOT mean RECKLESSLY DANGEROUS. No one enjoys being being matched against someone who intentionally or uncontrollably injures training partners. Play like that and very soon you won’t have anyone to play with. I mean someone who plays with control but who conveys the feeling that if they wanted to do harm, they absolutely have the firepower to do so. The best way for you to create this aura is to have a STRONG SUBMISSIONS GAME. Nothing scares opponents in Jiu jitsu as much as the threat of being FINISHED. Make sure that you devote time in your training to developing a strong submissions arsenal and you’ll always get a healthy respect from all opponents that will result in them taking fewer risks and attacks against you for fear of the consequences. Never be happy with a neutered Jiu jitsu that presents no danger to opponents. What makes Jiu jitsu a MARTIAL art is submissions - never lose sight of this
