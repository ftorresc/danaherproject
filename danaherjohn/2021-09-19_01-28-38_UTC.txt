Don’t just attack the submission - attack his base of support AND the submission and you’ll double your chances of success: It hard enough to defend a well applied submission hold at the best of times - it’s considerably more difficult when you’ve been knocked down to an awkward position from where you have no ability to apply strength or movement. Make use of this insight whenever you can. If you catch an opponent in a good lock - look immediately to go the extra distance and lock them out if their base of support so that they have TWO tasks - they have to defend the submission hold AND recover their base - the former is not possible until they perform the latter. This will give you a much greater chance of finishing them than just the hold itself. Here, Gordon Ryan makes an already very dangerous triangle even more so by knocking his opponent down - defending from a broken down position like this will be nearly impossible
