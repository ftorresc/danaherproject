Round 2: The squad always tries to keep a busy competition schedule against the best. We are excited to announce a greatly anticipated rematch between Marcelo Garcia/Team McGregor standout, Dillon Danis and Garry Tonon at Polaris Grappling on August 19 in London, England. Mr Danis and Mr Tonon famously met before at the world championships where Mr Tonon put on a fine display culminating in a powerful heel hook for the win. Much has changed since then. Working extensively in MMA circles has greatly improved Mr Danis' wrestling. His leg locks and strangles, particularly his guillotine, have also greatly improved. Perhaps most importantly, he has gone up to 200 pounds - Mr Tonon walks around at 170 and cannot try to gain weight as the world championships are soon after this event. Accordingly this match will have a very different background to their first encounter. Mr Danis recently lost a very close match in EBI overtime rules to Mr Tonon's team mate, Jake Shields, but even in defeat, he showed a great skill set and increased strength and athletic ability that will definitely play a role in this rematch. Once again, Mr Tonon will have to rely on his movement skills, technical precision and confidence to find victory against the bigger and stronger athlete. The squad always looks forward to our overseas adventures - hoping we can get more squad standouts on this London card and send a team to show our English/European followers our style and approach!
