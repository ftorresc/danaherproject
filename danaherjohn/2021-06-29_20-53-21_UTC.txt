When you get an opponent off balance he will be open for attack. When you get a GOOD opponent off balance he will throw up his defenses and you will need a second attack feeding off those defenses to break through. When you take a GREAT opponent off balance he will be looking to counter attack the second after he throws up his defenses and you will need to anticipate the few counter attacking options he has from that recovery scenario and base your follow up attacks on that prior knowledge. Your BODY STARTS the attack sequence, but itâ€™s your MIND that KEEPS you ahead against the best.
