You’re in a winning position - now is not the time for excitement: It perfectly natural and understandable that you should get excited when you get to a winning position against a tough opponent. However, getting excited won’t make it easier to finish. Now is the time for calculation and remembering the skills needed to finish the job. Stay cold and dispassionate and work methodically, the same way you would to solve a math problem - did getting excited or emotional ever help you solve a math problem? No - and it won’t help you solve a Jiu jitsu problem either. Save your excitement for after the job is complete and you will experience excitement a lot more than if you let it creep in too early
