All done: Both Gordon Ryan and Oliver Taza weighed in successfully at 169 pounds - now some down time and final preparation for the big show tonight. This will be the first LA ebi show not run at the traditional LA venue, the orpheum theater. Instead it will be at the Florentine Gardens - looking forward to a new venue and another chance for the squad to showcase skills and a philosophy @jeffreyschu
