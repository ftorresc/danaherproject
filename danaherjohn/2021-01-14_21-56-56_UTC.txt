Big congratulations to Garry Tonon and Gordon for winning the Flograppling fan vote competition for most exciting match of the year (Garry Tonon) and submission of the year (Gordon Ryan). Iâ€™ve always believed that good Jiu jitsu is directed at control that leads to submission and that this style is always an exciting style to watch and learn. These two athletes do an amazing job of representing that philosophy. This is the third year in a row that Mr Tonon has won this award - an incredible achievement and testimony to his attacking style. Both athletes continuously hunt for submissions - just as you should. They have different means of getting there - one is movement based and the other is control based  but the goal is the same. Congratulations Garry and Gordon!
