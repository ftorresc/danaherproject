Overseas adventures: Very pleased to announce three big overseas projects coming up in November. First, Garry Tonon will return to @onechampionship MMA in Singapore to fight Korean MMA fighter Sung Jong Lee on November 9th. That week I will teach a super seminar going from November 5th - 9th two classes a day at @evolvemma gym in Singapore showing the squad style to people traveling in from around the world to learn our approach to the game. After this I will travel to Australia to see my dear Mom (Mum in Aus/NZ ðŸ˜œ) and family and catch up with all my jiu jitsu friends in the Land Down Under. I will teach a super seminar in Sydney and probably in Melbourne if I can get organized! I always love to see how far Australia and New Zealand have progressed in jiu jitsu and would love to do anything I can to assist that development. Mr Tonon is training very hard as always and will be looking to show his progress in MMA skill - this is his first fight at 155 pounds and I am preparing a comprehensive teaching program for Singapore and Australia- I will release more details on the Australia tour soon! Canâ€™t wait to see you all and work to help get you to the next level! Until then, wishing you the best from NYC! ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—
