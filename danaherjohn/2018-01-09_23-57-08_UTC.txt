The essential nature of jiu jitsu is control leading to submission. All the various forms of control have a common theme - to restrict, stop and direct movement. Ultimately your goal is to make an opponentâ€™s own body unable to respond to the commands and wishes of his mind and thus, to make your mind master of his body. Then you have true control.
