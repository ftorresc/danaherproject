Blonde fighter ready for action! 
@blondefighter weighed in successfully today in Houston Texas for her bout tomorrow night at UFC 247 against the great Valentina Schevchenko. As always she has prepared very professionally for what is without doubt the greatest challenge of her career against arguably the greatest pound for pound female fighter on the planet. There is a real big fight big show atmosphere here in Houston with a great fight card filled with MMA super stars and talent. Looking forward to working with Mark Henry, the Renzo Gracie academy Muay Thai team and Katlynâ€™s wrestling coach and husband Kyle Cerminara. Hope you all enjoy the big show tomorrow night!
