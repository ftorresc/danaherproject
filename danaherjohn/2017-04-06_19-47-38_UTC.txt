Overcoming limitations: With some recent problems with my left knee, even demonstrating jiu jitsu is problematic for me now. Last night I taught a seminar at the dojo of my good friend and teammate, Carl Massaro. Through the capable help of our mutual student, Frank Rosenthal, we were able to give a good representation of our squads ashi garami game. It was very pleasing to see the room quickly pick up the main concepts and techniques and begin applying them. It gives me confidence that whatever happens in the future, I can still be of use to my beloved students and the sport. It amazed me to see relative beginners to the leg locking game quickly slipping into position and applying the locks correctly despite my current inability to show them physically myself. Thanks to Carl Massaro and his students for a lovely night of training and learning in New Jersey ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
