Like old times: Had a great morning out in Long Island training @chrisweidman along with @gordonlovesjiujitsu and @jasonraubjj89 and friends. Helping Mr Weidman prepare for his UFC title run and victory was a great highlight of my life. When he opened his gym with his primary coach Ray Longo in Long Island there were much fewer opportunities to work together, so it was great going out today and getting back on to the mat! Mr Weidman is unquestionably one of the most gifted athletes I ever worked with. It was fascinating seeing how he has evolved in training methods and approaches. His upcoming rematch with the great Luke Rockhold will be an incredible test for both athletes. Looking forward to more training with this team out on Long Island as fight day approaches!
