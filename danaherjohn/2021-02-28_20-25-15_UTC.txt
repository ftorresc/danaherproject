Back home in Puerto Rico! It was great to back in the gym today training the juniors for upcoming competitions. As much as I love travel there is a true pleasure in getting back to home ground and into a routine that builds the skills you need to excel. Thank you all so much for the interest you show in the squads development and growth. It was so impressive to see Craig Jones and Gordon Ryan show the skills we work every day on the mat so perfectly in competition. No technique, strategy or set of tactics is a completed project however - so as always it’s back to the mat to refine and improve what you have and discover what you don’t! Here Nicky Ryan and Nick Ortiz work on their back skills in preparation for upcoming matches.
