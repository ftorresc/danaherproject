Putting things together: Nothing gets the breakthrough better than COMBINED ATTACKS. Defending one submission is tough, defending a well applied combination of submissions is hell - that is why I always try to create thorough SYSTEMS around the most high percentage submission holds - so that as one attack gets foiled another can take its place. Best of all however, is when you can LINK ONE SUBMISSION SYSTEM WITH OTHERS. Now it becomes extremely difficult to stop an unfolding attack that is expressing combinations both WITHIN a system and BETWEEN systems. Here, talented junior Damien Anderson does exactly that at the recent Pan American Championships. Switching quickly and efficiently between positional pressure and Kimura and Back systems creates a chain of attack that quickly outpaces his opponentâ€™s ability to defend to get the breakthrough.
