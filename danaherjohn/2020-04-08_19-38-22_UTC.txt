The less time you spend directly in front of your opponents legs - the better: Whenever you play top position your primary concern is getting past your opponents legs. The overwhelming majority of your opponents submission and positional offense relies on his legs - if you get past them he will not be able to launch many serious attacks upon you, whilst you can launch many attacks upon him. Make it a habit to immediately step to an angle outside of your opponents feet and knees and you will make your job in top position MUCH easier. The second you get an initial angle on your opponent you put him in a defensive framework where he is only concerned with recovering his leg position, rather than attacking you. As soon as the engagement begins - GET TO YOUR OUTSIDE ANGLE - and soon you will find too position is a lot easier and more profitable for you
