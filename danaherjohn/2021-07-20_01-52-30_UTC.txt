Start well end well: When it comes to getting grip and/connection to an opponent - YOU MUST FACTOR IN EXPECTED RESISTANCE TO THAT GRIP/CONNECTION. Every time you make a grip with your arms or legs you can expect resistance from a knowledgeable opponent. This resistance will loosen and weaken whatever grip or connection youâ€™ve made. If you start with ADEQUATE grip/connection, that will resistance will immediately make it INADEQUATE - which will result in failure. If you start with PLENITUDINOUS grip/connection the expected resistance will lower to to ADEQUATE level - which is enough to get the job done. Keep this in mind when fighting for grip and connection and success will come to you more often when coming to grips with tough opponents
