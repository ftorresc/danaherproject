Dual threat: Nothing creates a sense of dread in an opponent more than having to deal with multiple serious threats at the same time. Whenever you create one threat, your opponent must respond with a counter. When you present two simultaneous threats it is difficult for him to counter one because that counter to the first threat will often expose him to the second. As a result many opponents will freeze in the face of dual or triple threats and become much more controllable than usual. Here, Garry Tonon creates a dual threat - one at the upper body with Kimura and a lower body threat with inside foot position whilst facing the hips (making for a very easy entrance into ashi garami variations if he should lose the kimura). Now the opponent has to defend both at the same time resulting in a situation where he simply has to hold his arm last and feet together defensively and thus preventing movement that would actually make escape possible. The result? An immobilized opponent. In this way you can see that THREAT is as effective for immobilization purposes as pins
