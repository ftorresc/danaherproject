Victory in Texas! Garry Tonon had a hard fought win tonight in Austen Texas over the very tough and talented Dante Leon. Mr Tonon was able to show off his usual dynamic attacking style with some trademark submissions and submission counters. The rule set at whose number one grappling shows really pushes the athletes to attempt submission attacks and few can keep up with Mr Tonon in this regard. Mr Tonon won a unanimous decision victory. Thanks to the organizers of the show who allow Jiu jitsu athletes to remain active during these times. They put on a stellar show tonight with legends such as Cyborg, Hulk, Ronaldo Junior and Wagner Rocha on the card. Wishing you all the best from Texas!! Hope you enjoyed the show!
