Regulating tension: When you first began Jiu jitsu you probably had the same problem everyone else does - you got very tense and tight and as a result quickly exhausted yourself. As you improved, you learned to relax and then you could spar fore much longer periods without fatigue being such an issue. Then a new problem emerged. In this relaxed state, sometimes the submissions you attempted were not tight enough and opponents escaped. Learning to regulate the muscular tension in your body during sparring is a huge part of your development from beginner to expert. In general the body moves fastest and longest in a state of athletic relaxation, so this is the state you want to be in for most of the match when MOVEMENT into winning positions is your primary focus. The body best exhibits control over another body in a state of ISOMETRIC TENSION. This will you need to find a balance between the athletic relaxation that allows you to move fluidly and efficiently into good positions and the isometric tension that enables you to lock on tight to a submission hold,  stay locked on despite the strongest resistance and exhibit sufficient strength to force a submission. You can see the kind of tension required for a breaking submission against a tough opponent as Garry Tonon shows his isometric strength with a punishing heel hook on his way to another EBI title.
