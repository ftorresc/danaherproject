Make it a battle of your legs against your opponents upper body and you will prevail even against bigger opponents and make it look effortless against smaller or same size opponents. An opponent might be considerably bigger and stronger than you overall, but his arms are not bigger and stronger than your legs. Learn to fight his arms with your legs and you will put yourself on a winning track. You canâ€™t always do it, but when you can it is a truly fine representation of the ideals of Jiu jitsu
