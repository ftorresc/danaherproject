Give me a lever long enough and I shall move the world: Chris Weidman and Gordon Ryan experiment with lever and fulcrum together. We work in a sport that is largely mechanical in nature. Learning to impose mechanical advantage on to a resisting opponent is our obsession. Ultimately you do not defeat your opponent - the laws of physics do it through your body. Look at jiu jitsu through the prism of physics and mechanics and a whole new world will emerge before your eyes and you will never the see the game in the same fashion again.
