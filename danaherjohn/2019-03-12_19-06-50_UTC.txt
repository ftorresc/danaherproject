Very excited to join @sanabul for the development of MMA training gear this year. I have been coaching MMA for a long time now and am fascinated by the idea of improving training gear for athletes to help create better workouts in the cage in preparation for bouts or just skill development. Looking forward to working with @sanabul in the development of shoot boxing and grapple boxing equipment to take your workouts to a new level! Stay tuned! ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ
