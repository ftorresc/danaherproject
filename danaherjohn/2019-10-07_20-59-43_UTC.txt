Grip and attack: A common problem that many students run into once they start to develop favorite grips from which to launch their attacks is a natural tendency to get to a good grip and HESITATE, as though the grip will get better with time. GRIPS DON’T GET BETTER WITH TIME. Once you get your grip - ITS TIME TO GO! You don’t have to set a speed record, but you don’t want to procrastinate either. Grips almost always get worse with time as your opponent will invariably be trying to break free. So build a habit of getting to your grip and moving seamlessly into the appropriate attacks from that grip. Train the grip and attack reflex and you will soon be experiencing more success with your favorite moves.
