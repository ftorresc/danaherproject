Preparation must mirror the event: In all your training you must ask yourself one simple question that is of supreme importance - DOES THIS WORK I AM DOING ENHANCE THE SKILLS I WILL NEED TO PERFORM BETTER? So often I see athletes working hard, but on tasks that have a very tenuous relationship with the actual event they are preparing for. Sometimes we feel that as long as we are working hard we are getting better. This is often not the case. Only if the work you are doing is relevant to the task you are about to undertake will the effort be worthwhile. Always ask yourself if your training really does help your perform the tasks of your sport better. It is quite surprising how often i see even top level athletes engaging in training behavior that even a moments thought would reveal has little relevance to the sport they are preparing for. It’s not the amount of sweat you produce that indicates how well prepared you are, but rather how much sweat you have produced working in ways that directly increase the necessary skills required for victory. Here, Garry Tonon is seen just two hours before his most recent MMA victory, practicing the very move that won him the fight in less than a minute. Striking into a single leg and falling back for ashi garami into a heel hook. A short time later he would use that same movement in front of an enthralled crowd to take his fifth win. Never stop asking “will this work make me better at what I do?” The speed of your progress is dependent upon your answer...
