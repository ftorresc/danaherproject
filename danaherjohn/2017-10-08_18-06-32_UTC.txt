Renzo Gracie Academy does it right: One of the great features of The Renzo Gracie Academy is the depth of teachers that enables our team to take on multiple projects simultaneously and get it done. Tonight Jake Shields, Garry Tonon and myself fly to Montreal to train  Georges St-Pierre in preparation for his upcoming bout with the great Micheal Bisping on November 4th in Madison Square Garden here in NYC. That means I wonâ€™t be in town to teach the infamous Monday afternoon class at RGA. However - great news - my dear Sensei, Renzo Gracie himself is taking over! Tomorrow the noon class will be filmed for Brazilian television as Mr Gracie runs the show. Let me tell you now - this is not something you want to miss. I always try to tell people what it was like to learn from Mr Gracie in my early days and always struggle to do it justice. Now is your chance to see it for yourself - you will love it! ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤— Canâ€™t wait to work with Mr St-Pierre and canâ€™t wait to hear the stories of my sensei teaching in his unique and unrivaled style! Great week ahead for RGA in NYC!
