A different kind of show: Normally when the squad talks about an upcoming show, they are talking about a grappling or MMA event. Recently however, I had the opportunity to work on a very different kind of show - the popular TV show "Billions" Season 2 starting up this week, will feature jiu jitsu and hopefully expose our beloved sport to a  very different audience. The cast and crew of the show were extremely professional and enthusiastic and did a fine job of bringing jiu jitsu related themes into the show.  Writer and producer David Levien in particular used his jiu jitsu training to great effect to create realistic scenes that carry a message and influence the action. Star Paul Giamatti greatly impressed me by training for his scenes and going through considerable discomfort to master some moves and do an amazing job of portraying the trials and experiences of a beginner in our sport. He was a genuinely nice fascinating person - deeply cerebral and wide ranging in his interests and knowledge. Here he talks me through the basics of acting while I talk him through the basics of strangulation- a fair swap ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜œ As the squad always says - hope you enjoy the show!!
