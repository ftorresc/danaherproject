Shiai preparation: Garry Tonon and Gordon prepare for their upcoming respective competitions (shiai) in a local gym in England. the high humidity and cold create a steam room effect that made for an eerie but enjoyable mist - appropriate for England - the misty Isle that has given so much to world history. At this stage the training takes on the same character as the final stages of sharpening a knife - the hard work has been done - now it's a matter of gently polishing the edge without removing any more metal - body movement and mental programming are the emphasis now, not physical conditioning or skill development. Mr Ryan's training is still physical as he still has a week before his event. Building the athlete to a peak over time is key here.
