The number one reason for losing training time in jiu jitsu is injury. It’s a contact sport - you can’t eliminate injury - but you can reduce the probability of injury by following sensible training protocols and eliminating the most dangerous positions and movements of the sport. I have just released a 100% free video for the jiu jitsu community through @bjj.fanatics that covers in detail my approach to reducing injuries in training - TRAIN SAFE. I hope to be able to offer a simple guide to making the training room a safer place and helping your longevity in the sport. Again - this is a free product - you can check it out any time you want at no cost. This is something I’ve always wanted to do as a way of using my experience over quarter of a century of coaching a program where my athletes train seven days a week up to three times a day and where reducing the likelihood of injury  is a key part of athletic preparation for the biggest events in the sport - I hope my experience can benefit you all. Wishing you all the best and a safe passage to your jiu jitsu goals!
