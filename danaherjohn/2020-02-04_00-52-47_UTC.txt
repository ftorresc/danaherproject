Don’t let a fascination with one area of the game blind you to other potentially useful areas: Jiujitsu is a game of oceanic vastness and none of us will ever come close to fully exploring all the possibilities it offers. It is generally best to focus upon a small subset of moves and devote a lifetime to mastery of those - better to be a master of a few moves than mediocre at many moves. Nonetheless, there are many times when we could expand our current repertoire very profitably with just a slight addition to our skill set. I will illustrate with an example. When it comes to leg lock entries from bottom position the main categories of entries are elevating, sliding, inverting and rolling. Let’s say you were already very good at the most commonly used methods - elevating, sliding and inverting entries. A really simple and easy way to greatly increase your leg locking effectiveness would be to add rolling entries. Rolling is a simple body action easily learned by most people and opportunities to use it are everywhere. It takes you to the same finishing point as all your other favorite entries and works with already existent skills that you have, so it’s not like you are learning an entirely new skill set - but rather a valuable addition to your established skill set. That means you can probably get great results with it in a short time at little cost in effort. The game is full of such possibilities sitting right in front of you that could make a real difference to your performance if you just identified them and did a little work incorporating them. Think about your current best moves and which new skills would best work around those skills. Once you identify some of those new skills, start training them and watch your game rise in level!
