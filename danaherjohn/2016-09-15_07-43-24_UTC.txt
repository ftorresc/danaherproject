Teaching in Australia: Going over elements of back control with the gi (whilst not wearing a gi myself ðŸ™„) at VT1 gym in Sydney Australia. So much fun - the Aussies are a true bunch of characters and very enthusiastic about the sport ðŸ˜ŠI am certain they will become a jiu jitsu powerhouse one day.
