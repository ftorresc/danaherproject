Getting under your opponents center of gravity is good. Getting out to an angle is good. Getting both angle and under the center of gravity together is even better! We’re always looking for advantage in Jiu jitsu. Getting one form of advantage is good - getting two or three together will make you unstoppable. Don’t be satisfied with some degree of advantage. Once you gain one form of advantage it is usually quite easily to compound its effects by snatching a second or third form of advantage. When you are matched with the toughest opponents in the room, you’ll need every form of advantage you can get, so get greedy with advantage and take every form of it you can! Grip, balance, position, elevation, angle, are all a form of advantage. Each one is an ace in your hand of grappling cards - the more aces you hold - the more likely you’ll break through!
