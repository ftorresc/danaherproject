Mr Crelinsten shows his mettle: The main event this weekend at Global Grappling League this past weekend was Nicky Ryan vs Marvin Castelle - a match Mr Ryan won rather quickly by submission. The co-main event was equally decisive- Ethan Crelinsten, one of our Canadian contingent, took on 10th planet standout JM Holland, and locked in a tight juji gatame arm lock for his second submission win over Mr Holland in the last month. Interestingly, this coming weekend, Mr Crelinsten will have a match with the very same Marvin Castelle who headlined against Mr Ryan, only this time it will be in Florida and under a very different rule set that allows points for pushing an opponent out bounds and other unusual elements. Both athletes have an approach which focuses upon submissions rather than wrestling skills, so I suspect the rule set will not play into the match too much. Mr Crelinsten is keeping up an extremely high work rate in local competition and getting great results
