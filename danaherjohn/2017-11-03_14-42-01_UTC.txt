The lonely vigil: Georges St-Pierre goes through light sauna in what was the easiest weight cut of his life. At the end of his welterweight career he was among the smaller men of his division, so making weight a division above was very simple indeed - just a few minutes in the oven and his official weigh in is complete  now at 184.8 pounds. We are off  to breakfast and recharging the batteries. Good to see so many familiar faces at the UFC staff and fighters and coaches ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š Big hello to my great friend and one of my inspirations @1carlosmachado1 who is here with old friend @wonderboymma
