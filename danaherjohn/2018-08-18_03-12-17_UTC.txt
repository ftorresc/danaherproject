Excited for Kasai Grappling 3 Tomorrow night! A great night of grappling tomorrow night in NYC @kasaigrappling in the Hammerstein Ballroom. The headline bout will be between outstanding Australian grappler Craig Jones and Brazilian powerhouse Rousimar Palhares. Mr Palhares was supposed to weigh in at 185 pounds but showed up at 218, apparently unaware that he had to make a weight limit. Mr Jones will probably weigh a little over 200 pounds. They have very different body types, demeanors and styles, so it should be a fascinating match. Mr Jones has been training in the basement with the squad - in addition to being one of the most talented grapplers on the circuit, he is also a genuinely good person - wishing him the best of luck in what will doubtless be one of the most anticipated matches of the year. The squad juniors are out in force - doing what we like to see - working on their skills and letting hard work, skill development and ambition get them to a higher level. Ethan Crelinsten, Nick Ronan, Frank Rosenthal and Jason Rau all take on very tough opponents in this elite level event as they continue their drive to the next level. Two former RGA students, Gianni Grippo and Jon Calestine will showcase two very different styles in a great match up as well. Congratulations to @kasaigrappling for getting a such a great card in such a great venue. While the athletes work hard to take themselves to a new level, Kasai are helping take the sport as a whole to a new level. Thank you for giving all these outstanding athletes a venue to showcase their skills.
