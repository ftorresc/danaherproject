Push and pull: All grappling is based on contact and connection with an opponent and a large factor in whether that connection will be favorable to you or your opponent will come from your ability to push and pull your opponent in ways that create advantage for you. PUSHING creates and maintains space; PULLING denies space. The COMBINATION of pulling and pushing off balances and breaks an opponents posture. LEARNING TO USE PUSHING AND PULLING TOGETHER KEEP SPACE WHEN YOU NEED IT, DENY SPACE WHEN YOU DON’T AND JOLT AND OFF BALANCE OPPONENTS IN NEUTRAL POSITIONS TO BREAK THEIR STANCE IS THE FOUNDATION OF GRAPPLING. Next time you put hands on an opponent, don’t just grip them - PLAY WITH PULL AND PUSH TO GAIN ADVANTAGE FROM THE ONSET OF CONTACT!
