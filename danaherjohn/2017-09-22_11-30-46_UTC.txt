Squad gets last light workout in: When the squad travels, we always like to get a light workout in the day before competition. Today we worked out in a place like no other before! This jiu jitsu gym in Finland is a former nuclear bomb shelter! It is deep underground encased in reinforced concrete! It looks like something from a James Bond movie - a jiu jitsu lair! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ We work out every day on the blue basement back in NYC, but this is a whole new level of dungeon! The squad was joined by beloved sensei Renzo Gracie and superstars Lovato Jr and Xandre Ribeiro among others. It was great watching everyone roll together and listening/watching a great interchange of jiu jitsu ideas and concepts used by so many great champions. Experiences like these are always among my favorite coaching memories. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š Now itâ€™s off to rules meeting and official weigh in ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
