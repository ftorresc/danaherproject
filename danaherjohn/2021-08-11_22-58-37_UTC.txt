Intensity: The sport of Jiu jitsu is ideally a mix of mostly relaxed efficiency mixed with spurts of ultra high intensity at the moments where either a big score or a submission is being attempted. Learning to guard when to be relaxed and when to go hard is a huge part of your development. Remember always to put a cap on your intensity - both in terms of HOW OFTEN you go into maximum intensity level and HOW LONG you stay there. Mistakes with either will quickly get you exhausted and unable to go into overdrive when you really need it. The first skill you learn is to monitor your OPPONENT, but as you go further will find that it is just as important to monitor YOURSELF so that you do not get exhausted before you attain victory
