Heading to LA: Big weekend in California with the North American West Coast ADCC trials. Heading out to help coach and then a seminar Sunday morning at @5starmartialarts then a quick turnaround back to NYC to help Garry Tonon get ready for his next MMA fight. I donâ€™t know if running around after these kids keeps me young or makes me old! ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ As long as everyone is having fun and getting closer to their dreams and goals itâ€™s all worth it! ğŸ˜œğŸ˜œ
