Last day in Puerto Rico: I had a great time today teaching a seminar here in Puerto Rico to benefit local Jiu jitsu schools and associations running competitions for local athletes. Itâ€™s been an amazing experience watching some of the local Jiu jitsu athletes learn and improve this last year. Today we went over many ways to control and finish from back positions - a favorite theme in my teaching. Tomorrow morning I will fly out to Austin Texas to start in a new locale and doubtless new adventures. Thank you to all the people who helped us train and prepare for competitions this last year in Puerto Rico!
