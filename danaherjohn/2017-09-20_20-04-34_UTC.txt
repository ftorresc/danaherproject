Teaching and training: A very nice seminar here today in Finland at JKL Fight Club @jkl_fightclub where I went over our approach to leg locking and ashi garami. Afterwards we switched gears to contest (shiai) preparation with the squad doing final preparation work. Tomorrow we head back towards Helsinki and the arena in Espoo, close by. Thanks so much to our hosts here in Finland who made us so welcome and made for a great seminar today.
