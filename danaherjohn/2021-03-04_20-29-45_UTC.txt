Open guard knees to chest: People talk about posture all the time in Jiu jitsu - understand from the start that different situations will require different postures from you to maximize your efficiency. When it comes to open guard - if you do not have a controlling grip on your opponent - be sure to KEEP YOUR KNEES CLOSE TO YOUR CHEST. This lessens the chance of an opponent explosively clearing your legs and passing before you can react. It also lessens the danger of a quick leg lock entry by the top player. In short - it makes you DEFENSIVELY SOUND at all times until you can get a solid grip upon your opponent that allows you to focus on offense. Here, Australian grappling Star Craig Jones shows near perfect open guard posture, necessary because he does not yet have a controlling grip upon his partner.
