All limbs working in unity: When beginners come to jiu jitsu, they grapple primarily with their arms. As they gain in skill, they learn to grapple with their legs. Mastery however, will only come when they come to use their arms and legs in unison. Your legs provide the horsepower to your bottom game, your arms (through grips) provide the ability to apply that horse in meaningful ways to your opponent. Think of your legs as the engine, your arms as the transmission that allows you to apply that power to your opponents body. Here Eddie Cummings shows fine unity of purpose between upper and lower body work - legs and arms working in unison to destabilize his opponent in directs that will set up his attacks Photo by Tiago Molinos
