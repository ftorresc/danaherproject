Angle is your friend: Gunning for submissions underneath a tough opponent is never easy work - but you can generally make it easier if you consistently look for side on angles that result in your hips coming out to one side rather than being square on and exposed to all of your opponents weight in vulnerable stacking positions. Arm bars, triangles, omoplatas all benefit from getting your hips out. Often a big help is to scoop your arm deep inside your opponents leg and use it to help pull yourself to a good angle. Whatever method you opt for, look to get hips out/side on, and soon you will suffering a lot fewer failures to to stacking counters to your favorite submissions from bottom position
