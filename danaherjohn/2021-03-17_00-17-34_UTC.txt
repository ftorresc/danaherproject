Tension and relaxation: Jiu jitsu is a game that requires from us great variations in states of muscular tension and relaxation. If you’re too tense too long you will quickly exhaust yourself and your movements will be stiff and inefficient. Too relaxed too long and you won’t be able to hold and control a wildly resisting opponent when pinning him or going for submission attempts. Different scenarios require different physical dispositions in terms of muscular effort. The LESS CONTACT with an opponent the LOWER the tension level. The more you engage in MOVEMENT the LOWER the tension levels. The more you engage in STOPPING movement the HIGHER the tension levels. Use these simple rules to guide your degree of muscular tension so that you can exhibit good endurance and good movement quality while at the same able to lock someone in place with sufficient control to pin opponents and finish them.
