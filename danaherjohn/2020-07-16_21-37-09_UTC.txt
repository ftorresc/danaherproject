Double your submission success rate by attacking posture as well as the submission: We work in a sport where all the highest percentage submission holds and their counters are known by both athletes. This makes it very difficult to apply them successfully against someone your own size and skill level. One of the best ways to improve this situation is to understand that strong submission defense requires a strong posture from the defense can be fought. IF YOU CAN BREAK HIS POSTURE WHILST HE IS DESPERATELY DEFENDING THE SUBMISSION YOU GREATLY UNDERMINE ANY DEFENSIVE MOVE HE MAY TRY TO EMPLOY - as a result - you will get a lot more submission success. Donâ€™t be happy with just getting the submission locked on and then try to fight to completion. Go the extra distance and try to break his posture at the same time. Now your opponent has TWO problems to solve at the same time. Here, submission master Gordon Ryan locks on a devastating triangle and simultaneously breaks his partners posture to thoroughly undermine any attempt at defense.
