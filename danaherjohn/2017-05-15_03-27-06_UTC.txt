A fine win for Jake Shields tonight against Marcelo Garcia/Team McGregor standout Dillon Danis at SUG 4 tonight. Mr Shields overcame the odds (at one point he was a 7-1 underdog) to take a tough victory in the EBI format overtime on fastest escape time. It is a testimony to Mr Shields tremendous work ethic that he can take on a star grappler much younger than himself in a format that he has little experience and take a victory. It was so impressive to watch over the last two months as Mr Shields came in twice a day every day to train with the squad, some of them half his age. Most athletes with Mr Shields experience and record begin to coast in training - he never did- every session was like a contest and he took on the difficult skills of EBI overtime, particularly escapes, and made tremendous progress, despite the fact that it was far removed from his normal game and skill set. What a fine example of a mature athlete staying focused, learning new skills, adapting over time and coming through for a tight, but well deserved victory. Stockton bitches!! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
