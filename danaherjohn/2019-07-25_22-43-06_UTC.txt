We all have our favorites: A huge part of your progress comes from acquiring and developing your FAVORITE MOVES (tokui-waza). These are the moves that suite your body type and personality more than any others and with which you show early promise. Remember you are involved in a sport where A PERFECT APPLICATION OF ONE MOVE WILL WIN A MATCH, BUT THE IMPERFECT APPLICATION OF A HUNDRED MOVES WONâ€™T DO A DAMN THING. When you acquire some favorites that seem to work for you - preferably high percentage moves - DEVOTE A BIG PART OF YOUR TRAINING TIME TO ENLARGE AND PERFECT YOUR UNDERSTANDING AND PERFORMANCE OF THISE MOVES. How good you get at those favorite moves will determine how good you get at the sport overall. Only once you have some heavy hitting main weapons can you branch off those main attacks to add new directions to your game. Let your opponent react to your main weapons and defeat him on his reactions to the strong initial threat - that is the pattern of good Jiu Jitsu for most people. Here, Georges St-Pierre works one of his grappling tokui-waza - Kimura. It is the mainstay of his submission offense and the move from most of his other grappling attacks branch off. What are yours? Are you happy with them? What would you like to add in the future?
