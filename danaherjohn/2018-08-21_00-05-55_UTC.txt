Very excited to announce another super seminar in Reno Nevada at Renzo Gracie Reno - the school of Max McGarr - a distinguished black belt instructor at RGA in NYC for many years. He has opened a great school in Nevada where he does a fine job showing our approach to jiu jitsu. Canâ€™t wait to give our fans a detailed look at our systems based approach to jiu jitsu and training methodology. September 1st at Renzo Gracie Reno - three hours of leg attacks and back attacks starting at 10:30 am. Contact Renzo Gracie Reno for details! All welcome
