Victory in NYC! Nicky Ryan won his grappling superfight versus the very tough and distinguished Geo Martinez tonight in NYC. He won a unanimous decision and in the final seconds had a fully locked triangle from the back (an advanced element of the back attack system) and appeared moments from a decisive submission victory. In addition he appeared to have the stronger submission attempts throughout the match, along with more positional reversals. It was a truly remarkable performance from this young man. He went through a tough training camp and tonight on the big stage he did everything he trained for perfectly. He has a maturity and elan that is truly remarkable for a man his age. Eddie Cummings won a hard fought decision over the very talented Renato Canuto as he had the better submission attempts and overall aggression. Frank Rosenthal has his best performance ever with a beautiful heel hook victory over 10th Planet stand out Zach Malany in one of the nights highlight moments. I am so proud of these remarkable athletes here in front of their home crowd. Bless you all from NYC! Hope you all enjoyed the show!
