Incredible showing at ADCC West Coast North American trials: The squad juniors came out in force today in what was quite possibly the largest North American ADCC trials ever today in Los Angeles, California. Nicky Ryan won gold in the lightest weight category with a stellar performance WINNING EVERY MATCH BY SUBMISSION (heel hooks and back strangles). Nick Rodriguez won gold in the heaviest weight division - incredible given that he is only a blue belt and used an extremely impressive array of positional and submission moves to take gold. Stanley Rosa has his best ever performance, representing Bronx Martial Arts Academy where I teach every Monday night with my senior student Doug Pelinkovic. He moved like a panther all day to take the silver medal with many crowd pleasing displays of technique along the way. It was wonderful to see the youngsters take center stage and show how itâ€™s done - 90% Submission rate overall and not a single stalling call on the squad ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ As always I am so proud of their achievements - hope you all enjoyed the show!! Tomorrow itâ€™s MMA training for Garry Tonon and then seminar at @5starmartialarts at 11am - then back to NYC for Monday classes. Wishing you all the best from LA!! Thank to all my incredible students and thank you to all of you who follow our progress ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
