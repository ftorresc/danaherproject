EBI champs line up: Today saw the return of inaugural female EBI champion, Erin Blanchfield to training with the squad. Here she joins fellow EBI champions, Garry Tonon and Gordon Ryan, along with future EBI champion, Nicky Ryan and her primary coach, Karel Pravec after a great Monday afternoon training session. This tough and dedicated young lady makes the long journey from hometown to NYC daily to train with squad regulars and keep pushing her technical depth and expand her repertoire. Great to be back in NYC and seeing everyone (even a very jet lagged Garry Tonon god bless him ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ) back on the mat and getting ready for upcoming challenges.
