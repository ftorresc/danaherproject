Victory in Texas: Gordon Ryan won his fourth EBI title tonight in Austin Texas in a tough tournament - winning three hard fought elimination matches and then a dramatic overtime finish against Australian grappling star Craig Jones. Mr Jones has had a breakout year with an outstanding performance in ADCC and now again in EBI 14. In a very memorable overtime, Mr Ryan had to use all his escape skills to break out of a tight juji gatame armlock. He was able to prevent his extended arm from going into hyperextension and then strangle Mr Jones in the next  exchange. Two outstanding victories in two weeks for Mr Ryan - now itâ€™s back to NYC on a 5:45am flight to NYC to resume teaching and training as Mr Ryan and Mr Tonon prepare for the Kasai grappling tournament in NYC next weekend! Thanks to Onnit Gym here in Austin for hosting a great EBI event. Also thanks to Eddie Bravo and Victor Davila for putting on another great EBI and giving all the athletes a great venue to express their skills in a thrilling format. Thanks to all our loyal fans for your support as the squad takes on all comers ðŸ˜ŠWishing you all the best in NYC - to my students in NYC - see you all tomorrow ðŸ˜Š
