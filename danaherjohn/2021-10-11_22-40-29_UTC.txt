Pressure: when we think of winning in Jiu jitsu we typically think in terms of MOVES. If a move is performed flawlessly it wins a match. In reality however, we rarely perform moves flawlessly against the strong resistance of an opponent who has the similar knowledge, skill and size to ourselves. Typically what determines winner and loser is PRESSURE OVER TIME. it is the ACCUMULATION of moves performed to a level that stresses an opponent that wears him down first physically and then mentally. As time  passes his ability to counter your moves deteriorates faster than your ability to perform them. Learning to use pressure as a weapon is perhaps the single biggest factor in your effectiveness on the mat. You START Jiu jitsu learning MOVES, but you will FINISH it learning to impose and maintain PRESSURE.
