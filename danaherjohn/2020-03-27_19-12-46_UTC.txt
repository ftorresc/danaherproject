The three routes to victory in combat sports - the first is to have such PERFECT EXECUTION of technique that it can be known and anticipated by an opponent but he simply cannot stop it (this usually requires a skill and/or athletic disparity (speed,strength or size) between the two athletes. - The second is based on SYSTEMATIC CONTROL where the idea is to have such a an elaborate system of set ups, controlling grips and positions that an opponent is gradually funneled into an ever more controlling predicament that increasingly limits his defensive options until escape becomes virtually impossible (this is typically only possible when extreme control and a slower pace is available which usually means ground techniques)
- The third is to be able to DECEIVE an opponent as to what your real intentions are and achieve a breakthrough via feint/fake/misdirection that creates an opening or weakness that can be exploited before he can detect the ruse and create an effective resistance (this is typically done more in speed based elements of combat sports usually standing techniques where speed is far easier to generate than on the ground)
Study all three methods - you will need them to break through against knowledgeable opponents
