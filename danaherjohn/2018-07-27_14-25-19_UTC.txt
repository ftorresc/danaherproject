Victory in Manila! Garry Tonon won his second MMA fight here in the Philippines tonight. He took on a very tough and big Rahul Raju and won via rear strangle in the third round. It was an interesting bout, Mr Raju had a big reach advantage and staked his chances on a powerful counter rear hand. Mr Tonon attacked the legs hard in submission exchanges looking to  cause enough damage to prevent him sitting on his heavy punches. As the damage to the legs accrued the takedowns came easier and then Mr Tonon switched to back attack system to get the break through. This ends only the seventh month of his MMA training - I am happy he got more time in the cage in this fight and got to feel some of the adversity of a longer fight - all important steps in an athleteâ€™s development. Congratulations to Mr Tonon on a very nice win and deeper progress into the game. Thanks so much to all the sparring partners who helped the preparation - and thanks to all of you for taking an interest in our approach to the game and your support of what we do - hope you all enjoyed the show! ðŸ˜Š Wishing you all the best from the Philippines!
