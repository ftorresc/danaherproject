Itâ€™s a family affair: Proud moment for Garry Tonon as he wins EBI 13 in perfect fashion - every match via submission in regulation time to take the maximum prize money - and for the first time in front of his family as Mom and sister came all the way to California to watch his thrilling performance. Here we are backstage after the big show as a very youthful looking Mr Tonon (shaving the beard and dropping a little weight makes him look like a junior high schooler ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚) tells his family about his adventures and his sister reminds him he still sucks and mom tells him to wash the dishes after dinner. It was a joy to see the pride on his familyâ€™s faces after such a stellar performance and the happiness that that gave Mr Tonon. Back in NYC now - heading to RGA and then on to the Bronx to see how the bombers are doing with their submission grappling training.
