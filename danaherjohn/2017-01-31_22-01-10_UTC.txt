Variation: A common strand of thinking that I observe in coaches and athletes is the idea that there is a correct way of performing a given move and any deviation from that is a step in the wrong direction. This kind of sentiment works well in a beginners class where you are trying to give students a firm foundation upon which to take their first steps, but as you progress higher in the sport, there comes a realization that there is almost always more than one correct way of performing that move. Much more important than the move itself is the set of MECHANICAL PRINCIPLES that underly the move. BEGINNERS TRY TO STAY TRUE TO THE MOVE AS IT WAS SHOWN TO THEM, BUT EXPERTS TRY TO STAY TRUE TO THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES BEHIND THE MOVE AND WORK FROM THERE. This allows them considerable leeway in their actual performance of any given move so that fascinating variations and improvisations can occur, but which still work in accordance with the essential mechanical foundations upon which the move is based. This sometimes has amusing consequences - you will see a beginner claiming a world champion is performing a move incorrectly because he is using a variation different from the one he was shown, but in truth, that champion is operating in accordance with the same over arching principles. Here kohai brown belt student, Stanley Rosa, an outstanding young instructor of Bronx Martial Art academy under my good friend Doug Pelinkovic, performs a fascinating variation of kimura into a powerful submission win over outstanding Pedro Sauer black belt David Porter at a recent grappling show. Unorthodox leg and hip positioning does not prevent him staying true to the critical features of a strong kimura attack as you can see from the impressive power he generates in very little time.
