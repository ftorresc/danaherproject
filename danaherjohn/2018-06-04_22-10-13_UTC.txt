Auxiliary systems: Most of you know that I am a big proponent of a linked subsystems approach to jiu jitsu. Classical BJJ is a system based approach to combat. I build upon this through the use of subsystems - systems built around specific areas of the game that create tremendous expertise in that domain that can enable an athlete (often with less overall experience than his opponent) to trap his or her opponent within that system where they have a significant knowledge, skill and experience advantage due to specialization and can win from there. As these subsystems grew in complexity I divided them up further in various ways that aided students in learning and applying them. One of the more interesting types of division was that between MAIN systems and AUXILIARY systems. In the case of our BACK SYSTEM, the main system is built around a set of arm traps that allow an attacker to pin his opponent’s defensive arms to facilitate the use of the most high percentage back finish - the rear naked strangle (mata leão/hadaka-jime). There is no question this is our main method of attacking the back and the one that has garnered the most success in competition. However, in cases where we cannot get the breakthrough by this main route, there are four AUXILIARY systems that go in a totally different direction. Instead of facilitating the breakthrough of one submission in one area (rear strangle around neck) they employ a diverse array of submissions OVER THE WHOLE BODY. This play between the narrow focus of the main system and the diverse applications of the four auxiliary systems is a big part of what gives our overall back system its character. Here, Garry Tonon shows his skills with one of those four auxiliary systems- the rear triangle (ushiro sankaku) as he locks in an impressive looking strangle in training.
