Teacher and student: My Sensei, Renzo Gracie, and student, Georges St-Pierre, enjoying a fun moment after a great Saturday afternoon class at RGA with the squad and Jake Shields getting ready for upcoming competition. Mr Gracie always lifts the atmosphere of the training room when he comes by to watch progress - so much experience, so many insights and such a personality to make them memorable to his students.
