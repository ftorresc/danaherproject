Victory in LA: Gordon Ryan defeated Ralek Gracie at the Metamoris event held at Gracie Academy Headquarters in Torrance today. On a bet placed shortly before the match he limited himself to sankaku (triangle) and juji gatame (armbar) attacks - the bet was that it had to be performed between ten and twelve minutes - a closer time frame than the ten to eighteen minutes he declared earlier in the week. At ten and half minutes he secured the submission win via sankaku variation. It was an honor to be at the famous Torrance academy and see so much history  and meet people who were heavily involved in the early history of jiu jitsu in the United States. It created a fascinating atmosphere for the match, which had the no time limit rule structure of early matches in the history of the sport. Now itâ€™s back to the gym to get Nicky Ryan ready for Fight2Win Friday night, Gordon Ryan ready for Sunday night, Nick Ronan ready for Kasai grappling event in two weeks and Garry Tonon ready for MMA!
