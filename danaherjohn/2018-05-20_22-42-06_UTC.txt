Itâ€™s a wrap folks!! Just finished a crazy weekend of filming the re-shoot of LEG LOCKS: ENTER THE SYSTEM in Boston. Two hectic days - eleven hours on Saturday and nine hours today to produce around 10 hours of video content. Filming went well - I added a lot of new content. We stay on many of the same techniques and topics as the first video, but with many additions. The general sense of the new video is a leaner, faster paced, more action oriented production. Of course you will also have full access to the original as well so you get both styles. Now Iâ€™m on the train back to NYC back before midnight and then itâ€™s a long day tomorrow - 6am alarm and get home from work around 11pm - itâ€™s a good thing I like what I do! ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ Itâ€™s beautiful to take a train ride through New England at dusk in spring - always a reminder that thereâ€™s more to life than gyms and jiu jitsu. Next weekend I return to Boston and do it all again as I reshoot the entire Back Attack series (it had similar audio problems to the leg lock series). Itâ€™s tough, but not as tough as going to sleep knowing you didnâ€™t give your best to get an important job done - so come next weekend - back on the train bound for Boston to get it right! Wishing you all the best from the tracks in New England ðŸ˜Š
