Jiu jitsu for a lifetime: So often I teach people for the purpose of short term gains in the sport - an upcoming match, a need to quickly master certain techniques to overcome a given opponent or area of weakness...however, the best way to approach the sport is always with the long term mindset of jiu jitsu as a lifetime activity. It is always a special thing to meet people who have been in the sport over the course of a long distinguished life. They carry insight and perspective that is always enlightening and instructive. I have found that often they can illuminate problems in contemporary jiu jitsu by offering a viewpoint that has passed out of current vogue. Today after the big Monday afternoon class at RGA, my beloved sensei, Renzo Gracie  called the class in for a special moment - he awarded the coveted red and white belt to Marcio Stambowsky, a man who has lived and breathed jiu jitsu his whole life among the greatest men of the sport. He is one of only four men to receive his black belt from legendary Rolls Gracie. Even now he is a formidable presence on the mat with a beautiful game that represents many of the techniques and philosophy of his esteemed master and the other great masters of that era. His son, Neiman Gracie, teaches at RGA and fights in Bellator MMA league - father and son representing the classic and Neo schools of jiu jitsu. Joining us was Reyson Gracie, uncle of Renzo and Ruran, son of Renzo. What an incredible mix of youth and experience from the first family of jiu jitsu! Listening to the conversation and stories I learned about our sport than I did from most formal instruction! What a fine example from Mr Stambowsky for everyone today about how constant maintenance of our skills can make jiu jitsu effective over a lifetime and a formative influence on a new generation.
