Whatever the other fellow wants - do the opposite: Jiu jitsu can seem like a very complex game at times, but in some ways it is very simple. It is a classic zero-sum game; what ever is good for one player is by definition bad for the other. If you know what the other guy need in order to perform a given move, you can do pretty damn well by doing the opposite of what he needs. Thatâ€™s why learning how to attack with a given move often educates you very well in how to defend it, and learning to defend it often makes you better at attacking with it. Whenever you drill a given move, get a feel of what the three main mechanical requirements for its success are - that will give a good insight into what you must do to stop it being used successfully against you in the future.
