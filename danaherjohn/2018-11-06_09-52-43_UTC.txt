Changing the game: It’s wonderful to see how much better students around the globe are improving in leg lock work. Here in Singapore I am teaching a super seminar to people from all over the globe at @evolvemma Years ago it would have been difficult to teach advanced material to a group of strangers as most people were unfamiliar with even the basic principles of keg work. Nowadays things are very different and it’s great to see a room of strangers quickly assimilate information and work as a team to improve their skill - it’s an exciting time to be a coach! Wishing you all the best from Singapore!
