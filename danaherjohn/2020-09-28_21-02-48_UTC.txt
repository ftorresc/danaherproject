The basis of your confidence in your offense is the degree of confidence you have in your defense. Our fear is always that if we take a risk we will be punished with by being put into a bad situation from which we can not recover. However, if you know that your defense is so strong that there is simply no situation from which you cannot recover - all fear evaporates and you will attack with full confidence - holding nothing back. If you want an aggressive attacking game - begin your training by developing an iron defense
