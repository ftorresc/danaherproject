Getting ready: Grappling super stars Gordon Ryan and Nicholas Meregali training with Georges St Pierre and Giancarlo Bodoni in preparation for this Friday night at WNO in Dallas Texas! This will be Mr Meregaliâ€™s No Gi debut. He has been training very hard and making great progress. Gordon will be taking his match on very short notice after brother Nicky had to pull out with knee problems. He takes on rising star Jacob Couch. Looking forward to seeing these two beasts in action in Dallas!!
