A theory of pinning: Most people think of pinning (osaekomi) as the act of displaying control by immobilizing an opponent. This certainly demonstrates control and is a very useful skill in combat. However, when one make SUBMISSION his primary goal, total immobilization of an opponent is not necessarily desirable. The act of totally immobilizing an opponent usually results in totally immobilizing ourselves as well. As a result, we are unable to make the transition to submission holds. The goal of the submission hunter is thus not static pins, but DIRECTIONAL PINS. These are pins which control the opponent in a way where he can only move in predictable ways that we control and determine. Thus we can anticipate his movement and take advantage of the inevitable extension of his body as he moves to shift from a pin controlling the torso to a submission hold attacking a limb. Static situations rarely give opportunities for submission. As a general rule - WHERE THERE IS MOVEMENT, THERE IS OPPORTUNITY FOR SUBMISSION. Thus directional pinning, rather than static pinning, is the focus of those who favor submission over all else. Here I work the theory of directional pinning with the immensely talented Mikey Wilson, youngest member of the squad, who at age ten displays a maturity and talent  that astounds me.
