Big congratulations to Keenan Cornelius - Open Weight No Gi Pan American Champion! Outstanding performance by Mr Cornelius yesterday to take gold at one of the years toughest competitions - The IBJJF Pan Ams No Gi  in the toughest category - Open Weight - here in NYC. Mr Cornelius has been training hard in the basement with the squad here in New York in preparation for ADCC and wanted to test some of the new tricks and how they merge with his own highly developed game. He had some great submission victories along the way! Thanks also to Gordon Ryan for excellent cornering work - these two are training partners every day in the blue basement so know each other’s game well. Mr Cornelius is among the finest grapplers on the planet - it’s a testimony to his drive and desire to master a craft that he still seeks to add more to his already deeply impressive game and test it out in the toughest environments. Impressive work!
