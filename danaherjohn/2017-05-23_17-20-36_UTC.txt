Late night big city vibe - Asian style: Last workout of the day complete and late dinner at a Korean restaurant here in Singapore. Singapore hosts every Asian culture and what better Late night meal is there than Korean BBQ? ðŸ˜œðŸ˜Š A great night of training, plotting, game planning and general shenanigans for the squad as we investigate this fascinating city. Up early for first workout tomorrow and Mr Tonon goes through a long day of media obligations, weight/hydration checks (they do things a little differently here to ensure athletes do not lose vast amounts of weight prior to competition and thus compete much closer to their actual weight than they do back home), then second workout at night. We find a routine in a new environment as quickly as possible to become acclimated and efficient as strangers in a strange land can in the time available - part of putting on the best possible performance at show time
