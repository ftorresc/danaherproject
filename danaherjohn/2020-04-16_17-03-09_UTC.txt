Possible Bane sighting on NYC subway: I was heading down to the supermarket for weekly grocery shopping when I came across this fellow sitting on the train with some other people who appeared to be working on some kind of underground construction project. He somewhat resembled criminal mastermind Bane and so, struck by curiosity, I approached as close as current social distancing protocols allow and said, “Excuse me sir, I was just wondering if you are in fact Batman’s arch nemesis Bane?” He turned to me and said, “It doesn’t matter who we are...what matters is our plan...” Then he returned to a conversation that appeared to be about the stock market, nuclear blast radius and some guy named Bruce...should I be worried?
