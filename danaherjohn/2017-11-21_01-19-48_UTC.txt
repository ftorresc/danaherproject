Sankaku/Triangle: Jiu Jitsu is about using a large percentage of our strength against a small percentage of our opponentâ€™s strength at a vulnerable point of his body. No move exemplifies this sentiment better than sankaku - the triangle. In all its many variations it uses the strongest part of our body - the legs and hips - to isolate a weak part of an opponent - the neck and a single arm - in order to strangle or armlock him. As such it a big part of our approach to the sport. As a coach I use sankaku as a crucial measurement of a beginner students progress - the day I see a student consistently and persistently entering into and looking to finish with triangles, I know he or she is on the right path and making good progress. It shows me clearly that they are using their legs as the forefront of their attacks and are developing the leg dexterity and movement skills that will enhance their game overall. Rookie grapplers do the majority of their work with their arms - experts do the majority of their work with legs and hips. Here, Garry Tonon shows superb leg and hip work to lock on a devastating sankaku attack on his way to a record fifth EBI title in LA
