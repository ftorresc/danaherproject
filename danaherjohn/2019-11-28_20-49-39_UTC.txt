That look when you get to the Thanksgiving dinner table after Gordon Ryan and find the discarded bones of two turkeys, a cow, several chickens and something that could be anything from a fur seal to a small dolphin...all thatâ€™s left is an apple and some crumbs of stuffing...
Happy Thanksgiving to all of you! Wishing you all the best from NYC! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
