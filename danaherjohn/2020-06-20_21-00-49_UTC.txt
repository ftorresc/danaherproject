Getting better at pins in Jiu jitsu: Pins are the highest scoring maneuvers in all of Jiu jitsu. The mount and the rear mount score double what you get for a takedown or sweep. As such there is a great incentive to get there. This often creates a mindset where the pin is enough reward in itself. In the long term however, you must go beyond this and see the dominant pins of Jiu jitsu as not just a good position to score - but a great position to submit people. The key to making this shift is your opponents ARMS. Donâ€™t be satisfied with the pin itself - go further and trap your opponents arms. This will help immeasurably as you try to convert the pin into a submission. From the rear mount pin one of his arms with your legs and suddenly your strangle success rate will double. From the mount, walk your opponents arm out and away from his torso and suddenly you will be strangling and arm locking opponents at twice your normal rate. Make it a habit once you get to your dominant pins to start working on your opponents arms and bridge the gap between position and submission!
