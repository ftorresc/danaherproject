When two truly horrible people like myself and Garry Tonon are looking happy and smiling menacingly whilst looking at the same thing out on the mats, that can mean only one thing...some poor hapless student has royally screwed up a move that was just taught - probably locked a kimura with hands improperly placed, or messed up ashi garami leg positioning or even worse, Eddie Cummings attempting any move in the standing position. We are happy because we are about to launch into a fusillade of verbal abuse and torment that will involve several different languages, evoking many gods and as many different generations of slang and curse words as we can yell in the time allotted. #horriblesenseisatwork
