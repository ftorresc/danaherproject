Victory in Long Beach! Gordon won a smooth victory over Rousimar Palhares by quickly taking the back and controlling position until the end to cap off an amazing two week display of Jiu Jitsu after his double gold medal performance at ADCC World Championships. Now I am heading from the arena back to NYC - waiting for my Uber to LAX. Itâ€™s been an amazing time out here in California - so proud of the development of my incredible students and the interest and innovation they are creating in our sport. Now I will fly back on the red eye to arrive back in good old NYC! Looking forward to landing and heading straight back to teaching in the blue basement and seeing all my students again ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ Wishing you all the best from California - thank you all as always for your support and interest in our approach to the game!
