Neiman Gracie wins again! RGA instructor and grappling/MMA standout, Neiman Gracie had the honor of fighting in Bellator NYC - only the second time an MMA show has been put in in Madison Square Garden. He won brilliantly in the second round via classic stranglehold from the back against a very tough David Marfone in an action packed event. It was wonderful to see such a result - the move most associated with the tradition of his family in MMA, yet embedded in a very modern and well rounded game. Mr Gracie has been trained almost from birth under his father, Marcio Stambowsky, himself one of only four blackbelts under the legendary Rolls Gracie. On addition, my sensei Renzo Gracie, his cousins, Igor, Rolles and Gregor and the RGA Muay Thai program directors, Joseph Sampieri and Jamie Crowder. Sensei Renzo Gracie was there to corner him to victory last night ðŸ˜ŠHe put all his skills together for a very fine victory indeed on an action packed event here in NYC. His unbeaten MMA record is testimony to his professionalism in preparation, hard work and ability to learn so well from his coaches ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
