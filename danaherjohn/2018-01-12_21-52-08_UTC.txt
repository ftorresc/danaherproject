Danaher airport curse continues...my amazing ability to somehow screw up anything involving air travel continued today. I taught all day and got ready to go to JFK. As soon as I left RGA and massive rainstorm broke out just as everyone went to leave work - massive traffic jams of New Yorkers fleeing the city for the weekend but bombarded in winter rain storm - perfect ğŸ˜–ğŸ˜–ğŸ˜– Trying to run to the departure gate on a crippled leg dragging a bag full of rashguards while soaking wet always makes for a pleasant preflight experience ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ No problem - second last person on the plane! (I beat a giant fat dude who was breathing like Darth Vader) Looking forward to LA weather and teaching out West! ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜Š See you all soon!
