Juniors pushing forward! The squad juniors had a great weekend with @nickyryanbjj and @nickyrod247 winning big matches in England and today @katerinaleontyeva won the female tournament at 115 pounds at Finishers Sub Only event in Rockaway NY Ms Leontyeva was able to get fishes via heel hook, knee bar and kimura along with a dramatic overtime win against team mate @daniellekellybjj to take gold and win $2500 shekels ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ Its always a pleasure to see motivated people working hard towards their goals and dreams and the juniors just keep doing exactly that! Thanks to @frankrosenthal11 for coaching and to the all the training partners in the basement who help get everyone ready for the stage.
