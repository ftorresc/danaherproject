I am happy to announce the release of my latest instructional video from the NEW WAVE JIU JITSU OPEN GUARD:SWEEPS AND REVERSALS today. It features our approach to open guard play. The pressure of lower body submissions creates reactions that feed into our sweeps and reversals game. No matter what an opponent does - drops to knees, backs away, tries to crowd you or defensively hand fights - there is an answer to will get you top position. This is the no gi open guard play you see my students use so successfully in competition. Any attempt to stop leads right back into lower body submissions, creating a dilemma that is very difficult to overcome! If you want to build a devastating no gi open guard game, check this out!
