Lock out! Garry Tonon shows near perfect form in a variation of a knee bar attack last night in LA against Ralek Gracie. Such was the technical precision of the move that it got an instant tap against a very skilled opponent around 40pounds heavier than himself. It was nice to see Mr Tonon broadening his competition leg lock repertoire in such fine fashion.
