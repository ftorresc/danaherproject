The value of feedback: progress in jiu jitsu mirrors that of progress in science- it comes from experimental trial and error over time. Feedback from those trials and errors leads to a new set of theories which are themselves subjected to vigorous testing and improvement in the light of failures, problems and successes. Over time remarkable progress can be made. Gordon Ryan discusses feedback with me after training with regards our back attack system that proved so effective for him at EBI 6. On his way to win the championship three of his opponents were defeated from back position (the other via our leg lock system). Here we propose modifications and improvements based on his feedback.
