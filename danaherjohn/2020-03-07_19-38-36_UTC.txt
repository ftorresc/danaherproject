Big wins at a fun day of competition at local event for Gordon Ryan and Nathalia Santoro: Gordon Ryan and partner Nathalia Santoro spontaneously entered a local grappling tournament Grappling Industries in Ohio at the Arnold Classic fitness event while traveling for a seminar. Gordon winning every match by submission probably did not surprise anyone, but Nathalia, who has not been doing Jiu Jitsu very long entered the expert division and won every match via leg lock submission! This is a fantastic achievement for a blue belt who started the game quite late in life and who had no background in martial arts whatsoever. I always love to see episodes like this as they show what is possible with hard training and a good plan in a relatively short time frame. Ms Santoro trains alongside her partner in crime every day and has made incredible progress and today was her day to show off that progress. She hit a blitz of heel hooks and Achilles locks to take the gold! Congratulations Nathalia!
