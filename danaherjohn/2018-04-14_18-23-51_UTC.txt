Go Eddie! Had a great time at RGA this afternoon teaching the Saturday class usually taught by Eddie Cummings - obviously he is busy with the big show @kasaigrappling tonight, but all his loyal students can in and it was great running them through some leg lock material - here we all after class - wishing Eddie the best for tonight! See you all at the big show!
