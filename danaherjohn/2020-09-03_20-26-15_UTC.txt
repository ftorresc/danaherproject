Donâ€™t stand directly in front of dangerous opponents: The human body is set up to be at its strongest both offensively and defensively against opponents positioned directly in front of it. Just as a good boxer is very wary of standing in range directly in front of a dangerous puncher, and wisely always seeks to stay either out of range or angles off to a side whenever possible; so too, a good Jiu jitsu player is wary of staying directly in front of a dangerous guard and will use distance and angle to gain initial safety and advantage when approaching. As soon as you establish contact - LOOK TO CREATE YOUR FLANKING ANGLES AND DO AS MUCH AS YOUR WORK AS POSSIBLE WITH THE BENEFITS OF ADVANTAGEOUS ANGLE RATHER THAN DIRECTLY FACE THE PERILS OF A SKILLED OPPONENTS LEGS.
