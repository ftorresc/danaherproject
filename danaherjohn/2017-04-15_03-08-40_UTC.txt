Winning vs winning with style: Winning is the fundamental goal of athletes in competition - nonetheless the squad has always been proud of not just winning, but winning in a particular way - hunting ruthlessly for the submission. Our athletes will either get it or die trying. Eddie Cummings came into challenge for the Fight to Win Pro 145 pound belt against title holder Samir Chantre. He constantly looked to engage but he and the audience were frustrated by a distinct lack of engagement from his opponent. That lead to an easy unanimous decision Win for Mr Cummings and the 145 pound belt - but still, for us and, I suspect, the audience, it had an unsatisfactory feeling to it. The great majority of the ten minute match was spent with Mr Cummings chasing his opponent to the boundary of the mat and trying to force any form of grappling engagement - but to no avail. In the end he won because he was the only one attempting to engage. The good news is that he has the belt and his jiu jitsu has risen in level after excellent preparation- unfortunately there were no real opportunities to show that tonight - but I am confident that with new belt and title in hand - he will soon get opportunities in the future ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š Heading back to NYC from Philadelphia now. Happy to see Mr Cummings back on stage and winning new titles and looking forward to future matches that give greater opportunity to show our style to the audience.
