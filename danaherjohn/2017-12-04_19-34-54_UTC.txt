The remarkable Jake Shields wins again: With all the excitement of EBI 14 this weekend, we must not overlook the great achievement of Jake Shields in Submission Undergound Grappling. He took on outstanding jiu jitsu world champion Gilbert Burns in an EBI rules format and won a hard fought victory in overtime via riding time. Mr Shields is a fine example of an established athlete working hard to learn new skills at a time when most athletes are happy to just keep doing what they have done before. Every day he is in the gym working hard with the young killers. He is one of the very few MMA fighters in the world who can go with truly elite grapplers and win or at the very least, give them one hell of a test. His work ethic is an inspiration to the younger athletes and his great results a well deserved reward for his great efforts.
