Your mind may be your most powerful weapon - but your legs are a close second: The entire philosophy of Jiu jitsu bottom game is based on the idea that BOTTOM POSITION IS ONLY DISADVANTAGEOUS IF YOU CANâ€™T USE YOUR LEGS TO GRAPPLE YOUR OPPONENT. The whole game from bottom is to keep your legs between you and your opponent and to use them as your primary weapon. Here I work with a classic tripod sweep - a fine example of using the legs to engage an opponent standing over you. Remember that even though your legs are the power source behind the guard, it is your FEET that connect that power to an opponent - so make your feet grip your opponent with the same dexterity as your hands. This is a skill that takes time to develop but will be a key element in making your legs the basis of your bottom game.
