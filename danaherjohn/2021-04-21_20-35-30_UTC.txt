It all starts with push and pull: once you come to grips with an opponent there will usually be a brief period of push and pull that precedes an attack. This push pull action. Is often overlooked but it is of the greatest importance. In fact, I usually identify the relative expertise level of students by how well that make use of push and pull prior to applying their techniques. The old adage in martial arts is “when pushed, pull, and when pulled, push.” There is a lot of wisdom in this. Learning to create reactions and feed off those is critical to your development. You will need to stay relaxed as you play this game within a game and you will need to develop sensitivity to the opponents reactions to your pushing and pulling. Next time you make grips - start engaging in push and pull and stay loose enough to read your opponents reactions and move in response - in time your ability to break through with attacks will increase as a result
