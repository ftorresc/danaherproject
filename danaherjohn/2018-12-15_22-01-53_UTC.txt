Young gun: The 2018 IBJJF Jiu-Jitsu world championships are on this weekend in Anaheim California. The blue belt competition was up first and Nick Rodriguez @nickyrod247 was one of the emerging stars. This powerhouse came to us from @smashpassjay who is a long time friend of Gordon Ryan. He only began Jiu Jitsu a short one ago and Jay sent him to the blue basement to work on his submission skills. He soon became a favorite training partner of Gordon Ryan and has been improving rapidly. Even though he is a good wrestler he usually begins all training in bottom position to work new skills. At the world championships he won every one of his matches by submission! He used his favorite finishes - kata gatame variations from front headlock and juji gatame arm bars - to take the gold medal. Keep your eyes on this athlete - what a great start to his Jiu Jitsu training and a real inspiration to all you blue belts out there!
