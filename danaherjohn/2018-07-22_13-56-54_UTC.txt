First workout in Manila: Garry Tonon goes through his drills in preparation for his bout Friday night. Itâ€™s always a good thing getting that first workout behind you after a long flight, different climate and unfamiliar environment. There are two mild typhoons close by, so there is constant heavy rain making a wet and humid atmosphere that makes warm ups easy. Thanks to local BJJ gym metacore for hospitality and venue. Itâ€™s a great place to train while here In Manila. Now itâ€™s back to the hotel to recharge and get ready for tomorrow ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š Excited to see the big show @onechampionship arriving in force tomorrow- there is always a special feeling of anticipation and purpose when all the athletes and coaches and officials fly in. Wishing you all the best from the Philippines!
