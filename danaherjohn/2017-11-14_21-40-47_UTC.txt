Structure and movement: A good coach can look at a student whom they have never met or seen before and within a few seconds of observing them train, know very accurately their skill level. What are the cues they look for to make that assessment? An answer to this question will tell you a lot about what is truly important in your daily training and what is merely frivolous. The two most fundamental aspects the coach will first observe are structure/posture  and movement/transition skills from one position to another. Excellence is these two foundational aspects of the sport immediately suggests not only competence in the sport, but also an ability to easily learn new skills upon those already attained. Deficiencies in structure and movement suggests the opposite. YOU CAN HIDE MANY DEFICIENCIES IN JIU JITSU- BUT THOSE TWO YOU CANNOT HIDE, FOR THEY WILL PERVADE EVERY ASPECT OF YOUR GAME IN A DETRIMENTAL WAY. A good therapy to this common problem is to look regularly at the best athletes in the sport in competition or sparring (randori). Donâ€™t do what most people do, which is look only at the move being performed in order to copy it. Rather, spend time looking at the structure/stance/posture of the athletes and their movement patterns. Preoccupy yourself as much with studying MOVEMENT as much as MOVES and you will gain something much greater from your observation than a single move - you will gain insight into the foundations of ALL moves rather than one. Here Georges St-Pierre shows flawless body structure and dynamic movement as he transitions from a single leg to a head inside double leg as part of his preparation for his bout with Michael Bisping. Even a novice could look at this photo and see the apparent efficiency of the performance that comes from strong physical structure allied to efficient movement from one structure to the next.
