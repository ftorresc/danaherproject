Outstanding talent - Rayron Gracie: One of the most talented youngsters at RGA in NYC is fifteen year old, Rayron Gracie, son of the late Ryan Gracie. This young athlete is very big and powerful for such a young man, but more importantly, he is a very keen student of technique. He came to NYC to train with my dear sensei, his uncle, Renzo Gracie. In his time here we have seen an incredible rise in his effectiveness that shows tremendous promise for the future. This past weekend the young world champion got another chance to show the world his progress at the Kasai grappling event in NYC - he won gold in both his weight division and absolute - IN THE ADULT DIVISION!! This was no surprise to us here in the gym - we see him doing extremely well against black belt adults every day, but it was certainly a shock to those watching who do not know this young man. Mr Gracie is doubtless one of the top prospects to carry the torch into the future for the first family of grappling. Itâ€™s a pleasure to see his progress under my sensei and his cousins, Igor, Rolles and Gregor Gracie and also our great mutual friend, Bernardo Faria. Look for more great performances from this young man - this is just the beginning! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·
