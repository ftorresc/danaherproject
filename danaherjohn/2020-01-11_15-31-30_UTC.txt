Helping where you can: I am sure many of you have been reading as I have of the terrible damage being done by the bush fires in Australia. The squad, myself, Gordon Ryan, Garry Tonon, Craig Jones and Nicky Rod will be selling all of our videos and money from the sale will be collected by @bjj.fanatics go to rescue efforts. Wishing all our friends in Australia safety from this terrible conflagration and the sad aftermath for both people and wildlife. ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡º
