It’s not so much a game of making yourself faster and stronger than the other guy, so much as it’s a game of using restraints and broken posture to make the other guy weaker and slower than yourself.

In Jiu jitsu, as much as we extol gaining strength for ourselves, we venerate robbing an opponent of strength even more.
