If you can clearly articulate the problem - it’s usually easy to find a solution: The only truly unsolvable problems in jiu jitsu are those where you don’t identify it as a problem - and as a result you never even begin looking for a solution. Just as bad is a situation where you fail to identify the problem accurately and look for solutions to the wrong problem, or a pseudo problem or a part of a problem. Always have a very clear understanding of two essential questions 
WHAT EXACTLY AM I TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH?
And
WHAT ARE THE MAIN OBSTACLES THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS?
If you keep a healthy focus on these two questions, you will find it much easier to create effective solutions to the obstacles that hold you back. THE FIRST STEP TO FINDING A SOLUTION IS ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTION. Know what you want to do and know what stands in your way and you’ll have a better chance getting the question right from the start.
