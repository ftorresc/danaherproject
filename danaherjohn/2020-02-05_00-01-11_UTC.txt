Start small to finish big: There was a notable moment this weekend at the Kasai Seven grappling championship that has important implications for your own development in Jiu Jitsu. Nick Rodriguez finished a champion black belt with a nicely applied heel hook to take a fine submission victory. Mr Rodriguez has not been training long in Jiu Jitsu and like anyone starting out, submission skills don’t come naturally. When he first started working leg lock skills there was the usual feeling of “this will never work for me” “there’s so much to remember! How will I ever remember all this under stress?” “My body isn’t made for this move” Understand that everyone goes through these feelings and doubts. The techniques of Jiu Jitsu and submission in particular, are not born fully grown. On the contrary, they are born just as you were - weak and in need of nurture and nourishment. But just as time made you stronger, so too, training time will make your technique stronger. When you first start working a technique start small - just get a feel for the basic movement. Experiment with different postures and angles without resistance. In sparring, start with smaller, less experienced opponents and build slowly from white belts through blue, purple brown and black. Follow this gradual path of escalating degrees of difficulty where YOUR CURRENT SKILL LEVEL IS MATCHED TO THE DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY OF THE TASK YOU HAVE SET YOURSELF. Ignore the voice of defeat in your head that will always question your ability and potential and one day that weak and ineffective technique that you never thought would amount to anything will be one of the most feared in your arsenal. Here, Mr Rodriguez battles for the legs in the gym - on the long and frustrating path that led to applying it against a champion - that same path that we must all walk.
