Colorful characters: This weekend , one of the most colorful characters in MMA history, Chael Sonnen, will return with his growing show, Submission Underground for the fourth time. It will be headlined by two of the most colorful and talented grapplers in the submission grappling circuit - Dillon Danis and Jake Shields. Mr Danis is a founding member of the. "Dream team" a very talented group of grapplers working out of NYC under the tutelage of the great Marcelo Garcia. He is often associated with another great martial artist, Connor McGregor, with whom he is an assistant coach. The squad has faced Mr Danis before - at the ADCC, Garry Tonon had a fine match with him. That day Mr Tonon prevailed with a very powerful heel hook variation, but since then, Mr Danis has greatly improved. He has had dominating victories over BJJ world champions, Jackson Sousa and AJ Agazarm. In those impressive victories he showed great progress on his wrestling and leg locking skills along with great confidence. He goes into the match a 7-1 favorite, understandable, given his recent form. However, his opponent, Jake Shields is exactly the kind of man who likes to prove Vegas oddsmakers wrong and has made a career doing it. He has trained very well with the squad. He came here with a fine positional game and has worked hard to improve his submissions skills. This should be a great match between two athletes who bring a larger than life aura with them, combined with the talent to back it up, along with the confidence and attitude to let it all shine on the big stage. Break out the popcorn and the Diet Coke, this one will be a fire cracker!
