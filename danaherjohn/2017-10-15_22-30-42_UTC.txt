At the airport with Gordon Ryan and the ghost of Hugh Hefner: Heading North to Montreal to resume grappling training with Georges St-Pierre this week. Waiting on a plane - Newark airport. The squad will prepare one athlete for MMA and another - Garry Tonon - for submission only grappling as the four time champion returns to his roots at EBI 13 in LA this Sunday. I love the test of different rule sets and sports - it always brings out the best in the squad. Looking forward to seeing the team up in Montreal including my black belt student and very talented MMA coach, Firas Zahabi. Wishing you all the best!
