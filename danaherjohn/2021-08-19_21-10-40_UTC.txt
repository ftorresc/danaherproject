Resistance: We never really know for sure what moves our opponent will do in a match - but one thing we DO know for sure is that he will resist every one of OUR moves. Learning to OVERCOME and MOVE AROUND resistance is a lifelong study in Jiu jitsu. No one cares how beautiful your moves look with a cooperative training partner during drills - what really counts is how successful you are at applying them in a competitive setting on a skilled opponent who doesnâ€™t want to lose. This will require skills in SET UP. If you can disguise the entry to your moves in some way, then execution will be easier. It will requires skill in COMBINING MOVES, if you can follow a failed move with a second or third follow up, your opponent will often fail to follow the change in direction in time and be caught. Learning to disguise your intent and work in combinations are the two best ways to counter resistance in all combat sports - Jiu jitsu is no exception. Be sure to imbed your power moves in creative set ups and combinations and the principle problem of sparring - overcoming resistance - will be much easier
