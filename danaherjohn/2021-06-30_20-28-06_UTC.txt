Seminar in Austin Texas Friday 7pm July 16: Gordon Ryan and I will teach a big seminar in conjunction with @flograppling The squad always gets a great reception in Texas so we are really looking forward to this! I have always been proud of the way my senior students have a general shared philosophy of Jiu jitsu that they showcase so brilliantly in competition but at the same time they each are outstanding creative minds who come up with their brilliant variations and innovations so that each has a distinctive style within our team style. A big part of my coaching program is teaching not just skill for competition, but teaching as a skill in itself. As a result all my senior students excel at teaching just as they do at competition. Teaching alongside them is always a pleasure - if youâ€™re in Austin come by and see us! It will be a fun night of technique and squad philosophy! ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œcontact @flograppling for tickets!!
