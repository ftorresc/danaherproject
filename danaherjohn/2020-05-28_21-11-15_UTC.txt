If you can’t get under ‘em...knock ‘em backwards: A big part of my approach to open guard situations is to get deep UNDER an opponent so that you can lift and elevate them into vulnerable position from which attacks often succeed. Any kind of lifting attack will require you to get UNDER AN OPPONENTS CENTER OF GRAVITY. Pretty soon opponents will figure that out and start backing away from you to prevent you getting under them. That’s when you must start adjusting the direction of your initial attack from UNDER and FORWARDS to BACKWARDS in the same direction as their defensive movement. Playing these two games against each other as a dilemma pairing will make you a very dangerous attacker from open guard.
