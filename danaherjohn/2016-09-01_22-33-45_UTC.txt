Getting the little things right: We are all involved in a sport where the smallest errors can have the deepest ramifications. So many times I see tiny errors that resulted in failure at critical times - failures that meant an athlete can let victory slip from his grasp and then a short time later suffer defeat in its place. It is so easy to gloss over details that are easy to ignore until the day you really need them. Rest assured that when you think you know a given move, you don't. You have merely achieved a level of competence that you currently find satisfactory. One day in the future you will find yourself in a situation where that level of competence proves inadequate - so keep learning those additional details and nuances. Discipline in this regard is a big part of what separates champions from the crowd. Here, Georges St-Pierre works on his ashi garami attacks with my friend Carl Massaro as I add some ideas. The look on Mr Massaro's face suggests a level of competency has been achieved, but like a true champion, Mr St-Pierre keeps looking deeper into the lock.
