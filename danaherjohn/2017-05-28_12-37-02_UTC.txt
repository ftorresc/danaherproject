Pikachu checks in at the airport: We are waiting for our plane at Changi International Airport in Singapore - on to Dohai and then NYC. Out of nowhere Nicky Ryan reaches into his luggage and pulls out the weirdest outfit I have ever seen in my life - apparently it's called a "onesie" and he has the pikachu PokÃ©mon variation. He put it on and sat next to a horrified squad! When I criticized in rather harsh language his choice in clothing he took an indignant air and launched into a passionate defense of onesies as a clothing option for men. Then he unleashed the line that floored us all - "actually I bought this for Gordon." It turns out both Ryan brothers are onesie fans!! No wonder they won't wear a gi! They are used to the snugly softness of their onesies!! Garry Tonon's face tells his side of the story. I am trying to pretend I don't know Mr Ryan and trying to change my ticket to another plane. I can't believe he got through security in this outfit - I guess they were just happy to see him leaving the country ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
