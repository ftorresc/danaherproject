Back in the saddle: Propped up by some cortisone I came back to limited teaching duties today. It was great to see youngest squad member Mikey Wilson back on the mats. He and Nicky Ryan worked on elements of our back attack system, an area that Mr Ryan excels in. Joining us was the formidable Jake Shields, who continues to impress us with his development here with the squad. I got a chance to teach our approach and philosophy of back control and attack, and also display my superior taste in walking canes ðŸ˜œðŸ˜‰There is more to my style than just rash guards!  It felt great to teach even if recent problems with my body made the physical side of teaching impossible today - there is so much about our game that is mental/philosophical that I felt that some valuable input could be made regardless. There was much excited talk after training about Garry Tonon's match tonight at Fight to Win in Oklahoma tonight. Mr Tonon has trained extremely well and is excited to put our approach to the game to another test against the very talented and tough Justin Rader. Keep your eyes on that show - it should be a fine one indeed!
