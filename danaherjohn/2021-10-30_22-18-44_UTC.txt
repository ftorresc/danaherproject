Leverage and the spine: The spine is the longest lever in the human body. It can be used a a great benefit in countless moves and situations - and it can be used AGAINST you in just as many. If you can control both ends of the lever - your opponents hips and head - you will have gained a very significant mechanical advantage over your opponent. Look at how Gordon Ryan traps his opponents head between his under hook and his own head, whilst simultaneously blocking the hips with his right knee. Control of both ends of the spine like this almost guarantees the guard pass. Controlling one end of the lever is good - controlling both ends is great. Look for this whenever you can - it doesnâ€™t always come easy, but when it does, you will be unstoppable
