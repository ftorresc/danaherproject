Jiu jitsu in Singapore: On May 26, Garry Tonon will take on Japanese MMA and Grappling icon, Shinya Aoki in a 15 minute submissions only match in a cage during an MMA event. This will doubtless be one of the most anticipated grappling bouts of the year as both men have a reputation for spectacular moves and the confidence to pull the trigger when they see opportunities.  The next day Mr Tonon, Nicky Ryan and myself will teach a seminar at Evolve gym showcasing many of the techniques and tactics that have proven so successful for our athletes in competition. Martial arts have always had such a strong presence throughout Asia, so it is a great honor for the squad to travel deep into Asia and show some of our material. This week it will be a long one in the blue basement of learning at RGA as Mr Tonon goes through his final preparation, then it's on to Singapore - a long trip indeed, but the allure of a great opponent and a chance to teach in a new environment makes it all worthwhile. Looking forward to meeting friends in Singapore! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
