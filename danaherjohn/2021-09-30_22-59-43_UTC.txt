The stronger your initial attack - the easier your follow up attacks: It’s rather rare in top level Jiu jitsu to smash through your opponents defenses on the first attempt and get the score. Usually it involves elaborate sets ups, fatiguing pressure over time or combination of moves to get a breakthrough. When it comes to combinations, a weak first attack is unlikely to evoke a sufficient reaction from a talented opponent to set up a good combination. Worse still, it may be strongly countered. You want a powerful first attack that throws your opponent into a totally defensive mindset and evokes predictable defensive reactions that you can capitalize upon. Don’t hang back from the opening attack even though you know it’s just a ruse to set up the subsequent attacks - go in hard to create the reactions you need to make the second, third or fourth attack score!
