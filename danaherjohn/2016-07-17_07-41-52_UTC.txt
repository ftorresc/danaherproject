Yeah...we look totally normal. The squad heads out into the night in LA looking for a meal after a long but victorious night. You know it's a bad day when a bald dude with rashguard and a fanny pack looking like a demented Captain Jean Luc Picard impersonator is the most normal looking guy in the photo ðŸ˜‰ God help the people of LA
