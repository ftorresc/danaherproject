Filming in Boston with old friends: I went up to Boston to film a new instructional video for the NEW WAVE series. It was great to see old friends Bernardo Faria and Placido Santos! It’s a beautiful New England summer here. I love the fact that in this great country there is so much variation in geography and tradition that in a week going from Puerto Rico to Texas to Massachusetts was like going to three different countries! Now we’re headed to dinner to talk shop and get ready to film some more. Wishing you all the best from this New England summer to wherever you are
