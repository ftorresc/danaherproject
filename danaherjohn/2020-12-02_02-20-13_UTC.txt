Driving: An odd thing about my life is that I have not driven a car in thirty years! When I moved to NYC in 1991 I opted never to buy a car since they are not only unnecessary but a real burden in Manhattan. When I traveled For events I was driven everywhere, in Manhattan I mostly used subway and taxis for special occasions. My old Californian license expired more than two decades ago ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Not only have I not driven in thirty years, but cars themselves have changed enormously since that time. I learned to drive in a pathetic old British car in New Zealand with an anemic 47 horsepower engine! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ When I drove in California it was in my brothers Chevy Camaro which had an engine with slightly more than 200 horsepower - impressive for that time - to me it seemed like a rocket ship compared to what I was used to ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Nowadays it seems just about every car has more than 200 horsepower and weighs half what that old Camaro weighed. And many have three times that horsepower!! Re- learning to drive is going to be interesting!! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜œ Here I am playing around with an electric Moke - popular here in the Caribbean Islands. Looking forward to my Puerto Rican drivers license test!! Wish me luck - I think Iâ€™m going to need it!! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Especially with Gordon Ryan as my driving coach!!
