Keeping it fun: sometimes I talk so much about the need for intelligently directed training programs backed by intensely disciplined students that one could get the impression that training ought to be to be a joyless slog towards higher skill level. This is definitely not the case. In fact I have always found that overly serious and joyless training environments have very negative effects on long term progress. The inescapable fact is that humans are drawn towards that which they find enjoyable. The moment training ceases to be fun, it is only a question how long before you stop - some will last longer than others, but the end result will be the same. It is important to understand that a training environment can be both fun and very challenging. Shared humor is the backbone of the camaraderie that can produce a championship training room. The trick is to instill a sense among the students of when they need to be serious and hard working and when they can release tension with humor and training room silliness. Finding the right balance between the two is so important. Visiting students are often quite shocked to hear me cursing and swearing like a trooper at my students and laughing at off color jokes- I like an informal , but hard working room. Just always make sure the work gets done. Here I trade jibes with Eddie Cummings, who often exhibits a prodigious work ethic well balanced with a fine sense of humor and fun that makes him a huge asset in the training room.
