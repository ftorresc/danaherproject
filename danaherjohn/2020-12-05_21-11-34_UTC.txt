In Jiu Jitsu you can know the future: The whole method of Jiu jitsu is TO GAIN EVER INCREASING CONTROL OVER YOUR OPPONENTS MOVEMENT AND PUSH HIM INTO A MOVEMENT FUNNEL WHERE HE HAS FEWER AND FEWER OPTIONS OVER TIME UNTIL A POINT IS REACHED WHERE YOU KNOW WHAT HIS NEXT MOVES MUST BE TO ESCAPE - WHEN YOU KNOW HIS NEXT MOVE BEFORE HE PERFORMS IT - ITS VERY EASY TO APPLY YOUR CHECKMATE MOVE. This is the way of good Jiu jitsu. Take all your favorite submissions and start to research how options become limited as certain restrictions are enforced on an opponents movement. Learn to funnel everything down to one or two options. When you can see the future move before it happens and impose your restrictions and counters upon it early, Victory will be yours
