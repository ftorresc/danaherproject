New instructional video release! I am very happy to announce the release of the latest installment of the NEW WAVE JIU JITSU series SUBMISSION ESCAPES. This video focuses on an area that my students are well known for - escape from seemingly impossible submissions that would finish most people. In EBI Overtime time competition my students would regularly escape from world champion opponents in very little time even when taking on much larger and more experienced opponents. This gives you great confidence and also sets up your ability to immediately counter attack - one of the major themes of this video - so that you greatly improve the interface between your defensive game and your offense. This will enable you to keep the offensive initiative even against dangerous attacking opponents - a key part of my philosophy of Jiu Jitsu.
