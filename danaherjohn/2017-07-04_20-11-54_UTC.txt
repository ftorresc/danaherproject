Happy Fourth of July from the Squad! Our great country has its ideological roots in independence, liberty of thought, personal responsibility, all tempered by pragmatism. These are not only the building blocks that made America foremost among the nations, but also excellent virtues in each of us as citizens, human beings and interestingly, as jiu jitsu students. Wishing you all the best from NYC - train hard, have fun with friends and family, and ruminate upon the shared value of our virtues as citizens, individuals and jiu jitsu players - the wisdom of our founding fathers extends in all directions. ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸
