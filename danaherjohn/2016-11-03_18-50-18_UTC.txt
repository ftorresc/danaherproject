What exactly are you waiting for? A common problem when I am coaching jiu jitsu athletes is that of students second guessing themselves when opportunity presents itself during a match. Too often students are looking for a perfect situation from which to launch an attack. Whilst I would never advocate sloppy set ups or random attacks; I do caution students on waiting for perfect set ups and moments for the simple reason that they rarely happen and are fleeting in nature. As a general rule, once an opportunity arises, it rarely gets better by waiting - usually an intelligent opponent will become cognizant of his vulnerability and recover. Thus the skill of SEEING OPPORTUNITY AND ACTING UPON IT IMMEDIATELY is crucial to success. The great American General Patton said it well - "A good plan enacted now is better than a perfect plan enacted ten minutes from now." Once you see an opening, follow it with action and be prepared to follow the action through to your goal. This almost always garners better results than waiting for a better and better opportunity that may never arise and then force you to take greater risks as time runs out. Here, kohai student Eric Sherman shows fine recognition of opportunity followed by decisive action in the opening moments of a bout at a local show in NYC.
