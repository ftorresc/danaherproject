Quiet days in NYC: It’s strange seeing the city like this - almost no one about as the seasons begin to change. I’ve lived here almost thirty years and never seen The Apple this way. One of my first students @zimlion took some beautifully haunting photos of the city the last few days that give some impression of the ghost town that NYC has become. The city has an eerie science fiction vibe to it. It has created a time for something that modern life doesn’t give us many opportunities to pay attention to - our surroundings, the change of seasons and most important - self reflection. Wherever you are, I hope you are safe and finding ways to adapt and grow. This situation won’t last forever, but perhaps the lessons we learn about ourselves and our lives in this down time will.
