Back in NYC! Just touched down at JFK and get to renew my love/hate affair with New York - sub zero temperatures and a giant line for a cab filled with obnoxious  New Yorkers (I fit right in)ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜– Hey gang - training begins tomorrow 12pm gi and no gi down in the basement of despair, hope and learning! No rest for the wicked! Lots of material to work on - lots of goals and dreams to fight towards. See you all tomorrow ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
