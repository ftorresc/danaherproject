Classroom role models: An impression many people have is that the social dynamic in the gym is one of teacher teaching and students learning. This certainly may be the case in a small local class, but in a big and well established classroom it is an over simplification. A critical role is played by the senior students (senpai). They often have a more direct contact with the junior students than the sensei does and often are an essential part of getting the teachers vision into the hands of the practicing students. One of my most important roles as a teacher is to establish a strong cadre of senior students who assist in the learning process of the entire training room. That way one can create a room where there are many guiding hands to help those who need it and yet all are united by a common vision of the sport. That is one of the reasons why I always teach to the level of the most talented people in the room. It builds that upper echelon who can then assist me in getting the knowledge to everyone in time. I was myself a product of this system. When I was a white belt we had Renzo as our sensei, but also Ricardo Almeida, Rodrigo Gracie and Matt Serra as our senior students. They were incredible role models and inspirational to us juniors. I never forgot how crucial they were to my development and worked hard to build a similar structure when I began teaching. Here I am with one of my favorite senior students, Garry St Ledger, whose world championship level judo skills (in addition to his BJJ black belt) make him a truly valuable addition to the room as he helps immensely in the standing skills that are such a big part of my vision for the future of the sport.
