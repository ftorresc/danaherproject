Break them down to a hip: One of the distinguishing characteristics of the revolution in leg locking that the squad brought in was the heavy emphasis on leg locking from bottom position. In the old days the vast majority of leg lock entries were from top position. Indeed, leg locking was largely seen as an alternative to guard passing. This created a lot of naive criticisms of leg leg locking that seem almost quaint nowadays. Students were told that leg locks were a bad idea because if it didn’t work you would lose top position. Well - what if we entered from bottom position? Then there was no danger of positional loss - so that’s where I put my emphasis. There are MANY great entries from bottom position into an opponents legs - but be sure to realize that though your ENTRIES into the legs will be on a standing or kneeling opponent in your guard - be sure to knock your opponents down to their hips/buttocks (or at the very least one knee) before you start working for your FINISHES. It is quite difficult and risky to try finishing as a skilled opponent stands over you. Much safer to off balance him down to a hip first and THEN start working for the finish. Remember always that the magic of ashi garami is that it has a dual nature - IT IS JUST AS GOOD FOR OFF BALANCING/SWEEPING AS IT IS FOR BREAKING PURPOSES. Use BOTH aspects of ashi garami from bottom position and your success rate from under tough opponents will start climbing in the directions you want!
