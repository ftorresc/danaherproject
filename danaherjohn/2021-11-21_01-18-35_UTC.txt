Approach as every match and every scenario within a match as A PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED rather than as an ORDEAL TO BE OVERCOME. Your problem solving ability is among the most important elements in attaining victory - arguably the most important. Courage, tenacity, will, strength, resilience and all the other attributes and virtues are wonderful things - but when there is a door to be opened, hammering, kicking, smashing and ramming may do it, nothing does it so well and so easily as a key. Your ability to apply knowledge and figure out solutions is the key to every lock. Put your emphasis on that above all else.
