The return of the Wolverine: Eddie Cummings, founding member of the grappling squad, will be returning to the stage at Fight2Win Pro 56 against Jacob Sandoval, an outstanding black belt from the great Cobrinha, in LA. He will be headlining the event alongside Nicky Ryan. Mr Cummings has been working hard in the shadows - always seeking improvement and refinement of his game. Everyone knows his prowess in leg attacks - he was the first to show our leg lock Ashi Garami system to the world. Less well known - mostly due to the overwhelming success of his leg game - is his great proficiency in upper body attacks and his positional game. It will be great seeing him back in action ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š Interestingly, of all my students, Mr Cummings has a grappling game which is the most similar to my own, based upon off balancing (kuzushi) from bottom position into Ashi Garami, sankaku (triangle) and back attacks. Keep your eyes on this one to see some modifications and improvements on an already devastating game!
