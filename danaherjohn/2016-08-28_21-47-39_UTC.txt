Nicky Ryan - Locked out! Young Nicky Ryan, just 15 years old, was matched with older 10th Planet prodigy Derek Rayfield today at Gracie Nationals. Originally he was to compete in the adult tournament but was apparently pulled into a superfight by Mr Bravo himself under EBI rules. Nicky Ryan attacked with submissions and positional pressure before locking in a very tight heel hook variation to get the submission victory and reward for all his hard training. It is very exciting to see what this young man can do out on the mats - lots more to come ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
