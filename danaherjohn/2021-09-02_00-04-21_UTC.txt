Pressure: Pressure over time is the single greatest determinant of victory. It is rare to beat someone your own skill level quickly and easily - it can happen - but not often. Usually it will be pressure over time that breaks an opponent to a point where they mentally accept defeat. Donâ€™t be upset when your moves fail - every attempt creates pressure that drains an opponent - each failure adds up over time and compounds upon the next until a breakthrough is reached and victory will be yours
