Control of the head and arm is real control: You will often hear people say that he who controls the head controls the whole body. It’s absolutely true. Arguably the best form of head control is HEAD AND ARM control. In JiuJitsu you get two great ways to do this. The first is through the ARMS via FRONT HEADLOCK when you’re in front of people and SEAT BELT when you’re behind people. The second is through the LEGS via TRIANGLE (sankaku) variations. Both are incredibly effective and opponent up a large number of really high percentage submission holds while simultaneously offering unusually high degree of control over movement. Train your mind to see not just a head in front of you - but a HEAD AND ARM and use either your arms or legs to lock it up.  Very soon you will notice that you are controlling and finishing people that used to be impervious to your attacks.
