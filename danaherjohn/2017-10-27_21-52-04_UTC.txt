Rules of engagement: Any time there is a sport competition it is absolutely crucial that everyone involved have a crystal clear understanding of what the rules of the competition will be. It always surprises me how often, even at elite level, athletes and coaches are unclear about the rules of the event they are participating in. A sound practice before big events is a rules meeting where any underlying confusion can be rectified. Here, Eddie Bravo and Victor Davila, head referees of EBI tournaments, go over rules with the athletes prior to the big show. Here we discuss the exact interpretation of back escapes in overtime scenarios. At this event, we did not need any overtimes as Garry Tonon won all his matches in regulation time, however, in the past, knowledge of the rules combined with technique has been an important factor in the success or failure of athletes in these match winning/losing tie breakers. Remember, all forms of losing are a bitter pill to swallow for a hard working and passionate athlete,
But none is so bitter as having everything you needed to win, and losing nonetheless because of a simple failure to research properly the rules of the event. How strange that there are so many athletes who are fully prepared to put hundreds of hours of exhausting work into physical preparation for a tournament, but who are not willing to put fifteen minutes of easy work into understanding the rules that will play a huge role in who wins and who loses.
