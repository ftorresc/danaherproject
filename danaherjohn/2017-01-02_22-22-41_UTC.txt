First class at Renzo Gracie Academy 2017: So good to get 2017 off to a strong start at our Monday 12pm class as the squad gets back into competition mode. Sensei Renzo came to say hello ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜Š Over 80 people in an afternoon class? Where else but Renzo's? ğŸ˜œğŸ˜œ It was wonderful to see Sensei so proud of the improvements he made to his school - the new fuji mats are superb and proving very popular with our students, especially Eddie Cummings, grinning like a maniac as he works some elements of our back control/submission system on the comfort of Fuji smooth series tatame ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ Whoever new that ushiro sankaku (rear triangle)!could be so photogenic? ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜œ So great seeing all our dedicated and hard working students back in the dojo - looking forward to many more great workouts together through the year and taking the skills out into top level competition for another year of success ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜Š
