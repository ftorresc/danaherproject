You’ve got to start somewhere! I was going through some of my old relics from my early days in the USA and came across this gem. When I came to America in 1991 to enter the PhD program at Columbia I needed work to get some money together and worked as a bouncer for my first decade in New York. Early on in this adventure I became for a short time a body guard for a local money lender who went by the name “Fresh Money” - quite positively the greatest name of any person I ever worked for! He would hand out his card to all comers at local clubs as he networked. Being a man who carried cash for a living he was a target for attack and thus lived an interesting life to say the least. I always get a chuckle when I see his old business card and think back on the adventures I went through in those crazy early years 😜😂
