Two is always better than one: A founding principle of my approach to leg locking is that of double trouble - given that most of your opponent’s resistance to a lock on one leg comes from the OTHER leg; if we can somehow restrain the second leg, this will make resistance far more difficult for him. There are many ways to restrain that second leg. Which method you choose is mostly determined by the version of ashi garami you find yourself in (though there are other factors also). Here, Gordon Ryan works on a version from reverse ashi garami, binding up both his opponent’s legs as he works between a knee bar and toe hold. Constantly looking to manifest this important principle will pay big dividends in the leg locking game. Having a clear understanding of the underlying PRINCIPLES behind the main movements of jiu jitsu will enable you to improvise during a match and innovate in the training room - two things that will greatly increase your prowess
