Reunion: When Georges St- Pierre was getting ready to fight Jon Fitch, he kept telling me about this incredible Karate fighter, Steven "Wonderboy" Thompson @wonderboymma he had brought into the camp for sparring. He came back for the Carlos Condit camp and I was shocked at how effectively he used movement, distance and angle to set up effective strikes whilst avoiding counters. Later on, I brought him in to Chris Weidman's camp for Anderson Silva to prepare him for the striking pyrotechnics of the great Brazilian champion. The two worked so well together, they became great friends and training partners, swapping grappling and striking knowledge. Both went on to super stardom in MMA and many more accolades to be won in the future. It was a pleasure to catch up with him again Saturday night as we cornered Chris Weidman to a dramatic victory. Watching him illustrate evasive movement into strikes is one of the most impressive memories I have in coaching MMA. So often I hear people disparage certain martial arts as part of an MMA program - karate is a common target. I always laugh when I hear this - for I am quite certain that five minutes of sparring with Mr Thompson would drastically change these doubters opinions! In truth, all of the martial arts that have a sport component which necessitates live training/sparring with competition have valuable contributions to make to an MMA program. They each have areas of specialty that we can benefit from. It is up to us as individuals to find a balance between each of their offerings that works for us. Here we get a chance to catch up on old times after the show.
