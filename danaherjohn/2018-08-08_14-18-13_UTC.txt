I am very excited to announce that I will be teaching at the Evolve Gym super camp 2018 in Singapore November 5th to 10th. Over the five days there will twice daily training culminating in a three hour seminar Saturday - twenty three hours of work to cover techniques, tactics and training methods that will not only create performance increases, but enable you to make progress on your own long after the camp has finished. @evolvemma is hosting this event with people from all over the world coming in. This is an exciting opportunity for me to help spread our approach to the sport made famous by my brilliant students. Evolve Gym provides the perfect location for a well run week of training and fun with people from all over the world united by a love a jiu jitsu and a desire for self improvement in their sports performance at whatever level they bring and aspire to. Hope to see you there!
