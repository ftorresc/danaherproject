Mr Tonon goes forth: Squad standout Garry Tonon will be teaching a big no gi seminar in Oklahoma on 03/25/17 at Oklahoma Martial Martial Arts Academy. Mr Tonon comes across as playful, but when it's time to teach, he is dead serious about getting performance increases. He has a superb knowledge of technique and tactics and the ability to pass that on to others while creating a warm and fun atmosphere as he does it. Of all my students, Mr Tonon is foremost in exploiting and controlling the interface between standing grappling (tachi-waza) and ground Grappling (ne waza) - a critical part of our coaching program. In addition,
He is the best at creating scrambles and controlling their direction towards our favorite finishes. Often people talk to me about Mr Tonon and describe him as a intuitive grappler who just has an innate ability to get to winning positions - they are invariably shocked when they see him teach and see that there is a highly practiced method to what he does and that others can be taught to do it as well. If you are in Oklahoma and have a chance to get to the seminar - do it! You will learn the precise methodology of one of best grapplers on the planet. Mr Tonon is an extremely innovative student who constantly adjusts and improves upon the material I show him to arrive at a fascinating game that is very much his own. As with all my senior students, I often feel I learn as much from him as he does from me. If you want to see some of the most innovative and cutting edge grappling technique - get to Mr Tonon's seminar. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
