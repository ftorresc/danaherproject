Iâ€™m excited to have another chat with one of my favorite people in martial arts - Joe Rogan - on his podcast show tomorrow afternoon here in Austin, Texas. Mr Rogan has done an incredible job over the years of highlighting the role of Jiu jitsu in MMA to the biggest audiences in the world. He has a been a major factor in the growth of our beloved sport since its earliest days. His show covers every aspect of modern life but our discussion will of course mostly be about Jiu jitsu related themes. Looking forward catching up on @joerogan ðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—
