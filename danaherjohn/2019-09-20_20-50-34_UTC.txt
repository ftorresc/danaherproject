Capturing the head: The human body is essentially a skull connected to a spine and everything hangs off that - so when you control the head you control everything else by default. As such, we must put a very high priority on capturing the head whenever we can. THE WHOLE POSITIONAL GAME OF JIU JITSU IS DESIGNED TO GET US PAST OUR OPPONENTS LOWER BODY UP TO THE MID BODY AND THEN PROGRESS UP UNTIL WE CAPTURE THE HEAD. Most of the time we capture the head with our arms, but you can do it in very impressive ways with your LEGS also - via the TRIANGLE (sankaku). Here, Nicky Ryan locks on a devastating side triangle (Yoko Sankaku) which will give tremendous head control that can nail down to the floor even the toughest opponents and offer a great stranglehold at the same time. Remember always the GOAL of the positional game - HEAD CONTROL. Whenever you have the opportunity to control the head - take it - and control of the rest of the body will be your reward.
