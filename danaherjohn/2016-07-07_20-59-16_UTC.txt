Peaking for an event: The main purpose of our training overall is to raise our general skill level in the sport of jiu jitsu to the highest degree possible. The purpose of a fight camp is quite different. Here the emphasis is on maximizing our performance against a specific opponent or set of opponents on a particular date in a particular venue. As such, the training tends to be much more specialized and structured according to the time available before the event. As Eddie Cummings prepares for EBI 7 we begin to work on specific drills for given opponents. Here we work on leg pommeling drills in the ashi garami position where the subtleties of the leg lock game come into play. So many people see only the general features of this position and claim knowledge that they simply do not have. I often tell the squad "it is one thing for everyone to SEE what you do, it is quite another for them to FEEL IT." People look with superficial eyes and miss entirely the key elements that make our game effective. Daily drilling between Mr Cummings, myself and the rest of the squad keeps his skill set moving in the right directions as EBI 7 approaches...
