Traveling with jiu jitsu: I always tell my students - when you learn jiu jitsu, you never walk alone , where you go, it goes with you. Kohai standout Matthew Tesla has a deep love of the Scandinavian countries and often travels there. This presents him opportunities to show our approach to the growing jiu jitsu community of these great nations. Recently Mr Tesla entered a local tournament in Sweden - The Nordic Open - featuring two divisions at 88kgs and  99kgs. He entered both despite being only 77 kgs  himself. He won both divisions - eight matches in total, all via submission in the manner we prefer. Here is a fine standing entry to ashi garami followed by a nicely applied heel hook. Just as the martial arts monks of the old days walked the earth and took their skills with them to help those who needed it, so too, the modern jiu jitsu athlete must take his skills with him or her and help students wherever he visits if the sport is to grow and prosper.
