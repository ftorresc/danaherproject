The greatest submission of them all - pressure leading to fatigue: let me tell you something rather obvious but which has torment ramifications for your success or failure in grappling - EXHAUSTED PEOPLE ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO SUBMIT TO YOU THAN FRESH PEOPLE. Understand this - a BIG part of submission is mental - itâ€™s always an act of choice to submit and exhausted people are far more likely to make that choice than an opponent who is not under any physical duress. Learning to PRESSURE AND OPPONENT OF TIME so that they get NO RELIEF from the constant PHYSICAL PRESSURE and TACTICAL THREAT is as much a part of the submission game as perfect breaking mechanics and positioning. When you are sparring l, constantly monitor the physical state of your opponent and learn to dictate pace and position - for these two key ingredients will be the means by which you can make even a strong opponent wilt in time. Remember, every opponent will be strong and explosive at the onset of a match - your job is to test how strong and explosive he is at the tail end of a match. Pressuring an opponent into fatigue is as much a part of the road to grappling success as position, leverage and all the other major keys to a great game.
