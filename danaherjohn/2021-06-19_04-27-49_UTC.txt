Victory in Austen!! Craig Jones had a fantastic back and forth match tonight with the exceptionally talented Tye Ruotolo at WNO Grappling event tonight here in Austin. Mr Jones was able to show a whole new side to his game that he has been developing with a very fine display of takedowns, takedowns into leg locks, guard passing, submission defense and top pressure to take a unanimous decision over a very game Mr Ruotolo who never gave up and fought well until the end. It was great to see Craig Jones use the aspects of his game that he uses daily in the gym but has not used in matches. Oliver Taza also competed tonight against the young phenom Mica Galvao. It was a tough physical match and Mr Galvao showed his developing brilliance to win a strong decision - he will be a great force in Jiu jitsu in the future. Hope you all enjoyed the show! Now itâ€™s back to Puerto Rico to get ready for the next big challenge! Wishing you all the best from Austin!!
