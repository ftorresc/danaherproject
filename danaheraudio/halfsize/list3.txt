wavs/1.wav|We have looked at a lot of the theoretical elements of the kimura system.
wavs/2.wav|We have seen that everything begins with a simple bifurcation.
wavs/3.wav|The moment you lock on a kimura upon your opponent, the first question you're asking yourself is.
wavs/4.wav|What direction am I gonna take this?
wavs/5.wav|Kimura has two faces.
wavs/6.wav|On the one hand, it's an incredibly effective method of breaking someone's arm.
wavs/7.wav|On the other, it's an incredibly effective method of restraining somebody's movement.
wavs/8.wav|And in both capacities, kimura is incredibly valuable in your submission arsenal.
wavs/9.wav|We have seen that the basic rule of thumb we use here is that if we can get the hand behind the back in a weak posterior position.
wavs/10.wav|We're gonna go mostly towards submission holds.
wavs/11.wav|If we cannot get the hand behind the back.
wavs/12.wav|Then, from this anterior position it makes more sense for us to switch into other submission holds or other positions.
wavs/13.wav|This is the basic direction of the kimura system that I teach and use.
wavs/14.wav|We saw that within that general system, there are four main methods of kimura that we use.
wavs/15.wav|The standard figure-four methods, where we just use our two hands to lock up our training partner's arm.
wavs/16.wav|We also saw the idea of a cross kimura where our legs get incorporated into the kimura attacks.
wavs/17.wav|We saw the idea of a hybrid kimura, somewhere between kimura and omoplata.
wavs/18.wav|The legs replace the pushing hand on our opponent's arm and we derive tremendous breaking power as a result.
wavs/19.wav|And thirdly, we looked at the idea of a hybrid between triangle and kimura.
wavs/20.wav|This method locked in our opponent's head in such a way that kimuras became incredibly effeective breaking mechanisms.
wavs/21.wav|And I'll be coming back to this topic quite a bit more as we progress through the video.
wavs/22.wav|Used in this way, these four different kinds of kimura, locked up in the overall directionality that I mentioned previously.
wavs/23.wav|We've got a very effective way of attacking and working with the kimura lock.
wavs/24.wav|This special subsystem of kimura, the t-kimura position.
wavs/25.wav|This turns out to be of immense value because it enables an athlete in an uncontrolled scramble situation to be able to lock an opponent down for just long enough and exert just enough control to be able to go into very very high percentage finishes utilisizing either bottom knee or top knee to control his opponent's movement.
wavs/26.wav|With all that theory behind us, it's time for us to go into practical applications.
wavs/27.wav|I wanna start looking now at the most common scenarios in which my athletes use kimura in competition and in training.
wavs/28.wav|We're gonna divide these into three main categories.
wavs/29.wav|The first are gonna be top position, second bottom position and third will be standing position.
wavs/30.wav|These three categories, top position bottom position and standing position.
wavs/31.wav|You're gonna find that there's many many ways that we can use kimura in these situations.
wavs/32.wav|We'll start off with top position very shortly.
wavs/33.wav|I said earlier today that I prefer to see my students begin their study of kimura in the side kimura position where you're across your oppponent's side and you lock up a kimura.
wavs/34.wav|That was certainly true for understanding the mechanics of kimura, it's a great way to start your study.
wavs/35.wav|That's where I want to start applications also.
wavs/36.wav|Now everything we've done so far has started with the assumption you actually had a kimura and then what to do once you have the lock.
wavs/37.wav|When we study applications we have to get to a kimura.
wavs/38.wav|Once you get a reputation as guy who's got a dangerous kimura your opponents are gonna be doing everything they can to prevent you from getting into kimura situations.
wavs/39.wav|Let's start off with a general observation about kimura.
wavs/40.wav|If I'm in a neutral situation.
wavs/41.wav|Say for example Matheus has an open guard.
wavs/42.wav|This is a neutral position okay, there's good things Matheus can do from here and there's good things I can do from here.
wavs/43.wav|Pretty much neutral, neither one of us controls the other.
wavs/44.wav|And so, from a situation like this, Matheus would not be afraid to reach for my body.
wavs/45.wav|And he can do this in various kinds of ways.
wavs/46.wav|And that's gonna create situations where I can go into kimura attacks because we have a reaching arm, my head is higher than his elbow and my elbow is higher than his so I can easily go into kimura in this situation.
wavs/47.wav|It was relatively easy because Matheus didn't feel threatened by the position.
wavs/48.wav|Like side control, or mount, or anything like this.
wavs/49.wav|And so typically, they bring everything in tight.
