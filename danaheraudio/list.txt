wavs/1.wav|We have looked at a lot of the theoretical elements of the kimura system.
wavs/2.wav|We have seen that everything begins with a simple bifurcation.
wavs/3.wav|The moment you lock on a kimura upon your opponent, the first question you're asking yourself is.
wavs/4.wav|What direction am I gonna take this?
wavs/5.wav|Kimura has two faces.
wavs/6.wav|On the one hand, it's an incredibly effective method of breaking someone's arm.
wavs/7.wav|On the other, it's an incredibly effective method of restraining somebody's movement.
wavs/8.wav|And in both capacities, kimura is incredibly valuable in your submission arsenal.
wavs/9.wav|We have seen that the basic rule of thumb we use here is that if we can get the hand behind the back in a weak posterior position.
wavs/10.wav|We're gonna go mostly towards submission holds.
wavs/11.wav|If we cannot get the hand behind the back.
wavs/12.wav|Then, from this anterior position it makes more sense for us to switch into other submission holds or other positions.
wavs/13.wav|This is the basic direction of the kimura system that I teach and use.
wavs/14.wav|We saw that within that general system, there are four main methods of kimura that we use.
wavs/15.wav|The standard figure-four methods, where we just use our two hands to lock up our training partner's arm.
wavs/16.wav|We also saw the idea of a cross kimura where our legs get incorporated into the kimura attacks.
wavs/17.wav|We saw the idea of a hybrid kimura, somewhere between kimura and omoplata.
wavs/18.wav|The legs replace the pushing hand on our opponent's arm and we derive tremendous breaking power as a result.
wavs/19.wav|And thirdly, we looked at the idea of a hybrid between triangle and kimura.
wavs/20.wav|This method locked in our opponent's head in such a way that kimuras became incredibly effeective breaking mechanisms.
wavs/21.wav|And I'll be coming back to this topic quite a bit more as we progress through the video.
wavs/22.wav|Used in this way, these four different kinds of kimura, locked up in the overall directionality that I mentioned previously.
wavs/23.wav|We've got a very effective way of attacking and working with the kimura lock.
wavs/24.wav|This special subsystem of kimura, the t-kimura position.
wavs/25.wav|This turns out to be of immense value because it enables an athlete in an uncontrolled scramble situation to be able to lock an opponent down for just long enough and exert just enough control to be able to go into very very high percentage finishes utilisizing either bottom knee or top knee to control his opponent's movement.
wavs/26.wav|With all that theory behind us, it's time for us to go into practical applications.
wavs/27.wav|I wanna start looking now at the most common scenarios in which my athletes use kimura in competition and in training.
wavs/28.wav|We're gonna divide these into three main categories.
wavs/29.wav|The first are gonna be top position, second bottom position and third will be standing position.
wavs/30.wav|These three categories, top position bottom position and standing position.
wavs/31.wav|You're gonna find that there's many many ways that we can use kimura in these situations.
wavs/32.wav|We'll start off with top position very shortly.
wavs/33.wav|I said earlier today that I prefer to see my students begin their study of kimura in the side kimura position where you're across your oppponent's side and you lock up a kimura.
wavs/34.wav|That was certainly true for understanding the mechanics of kimura, it's a great way to start your study.
wavs/35.wav|That's where I want to start applications also.
wavs/36.wav|Now everything we've done so far has started with the assumption you actually had a kimura and then what to do once you have the lock.
wavs/37.wav|When we study applications we have to get to a kimura.
wavs/38.wav|Once you get a reputation as guy who's got a dangerous kimura your opponents are gonna be doing everything they can to prevent you from getting into kimura situations.
wavs/39.wav|Let's start off with a general observation about kimura.
wavs/40.wav|If I'm in a neutral situation.
wavs/41.wav|Say for example Matheus has an open guard.
wavs/42.wav|This is a neutral position okay, there's good things Matheus can do from here and there's good things I can do from here.
wavs/43.wav|Pretty much neutral, neither one of us controls the other.
wavs/44.wav|And so, from a situation like this, Matheus would not be afraid to reach for my body.
wavs/45.wav|And he can do this in various kinds of ways.
wavs/46.wav|And that's gonna create situations where I can go into kimura attacks because we have a reaching arm, my head is higher than his elbow and my elbow is higher than his so I can easily go into kimura in this situation.
wavs/47.wav|It was relatively easy because Matheus didn't feel threatened by the position.
wavs/48.wav|Like side control, or mount, or anything like this.
wavs/49.wav|And so typically, they bring everything in tight.
wavs/50.wav|So one of the biggest problems you face when you got into a dominant position like side is, how am I gonna get into an opponent who's arms are in tight like so.
wavs/51.wav|It would be one thing if I was grappling with a newer fighter who's arms were flopping around in the breeze and you could just grab a wrist and go straight into a kimura.
wavs/52.wav|But at the level you guys operate at, everyone knows what a kimura is, everyone keeps their arms in close.
wavs/53.wav|And Matheus has a position which I often refer to as a tombstone position.
wavs/54.wav|Arms are in like he is in a tombstone like so and as a result it is very very hard for me to get in on my training partner's arms and secure a kimura grip.
wavs/55.wav|First question we're going to ask, when people are in these defensive positions and their arms are in good sound defensive positions, how am I going to get them into a kimura hold?
wavs/56.wav|And if you're gonna call yourself a master of kimura, one day you gotta be good at all three.
wavs/57.wav|The first method are elbow penetration methods where I take my hand and I penetrate underneath the elbow and I get my hand into this position.
wavs/58.wav|Okay so any method where I go under the elbow and penetrate through the elbow is an elbow penetration method.
wavs/59.wav|That's one good way to do it.
wavs/60.wav|The other way I can do it is to start not at the elbow but at the wrist.
wavs/61.wav|And I got two ways of doing that.
wavs/62.wav|I can use supinated grips where my hand is palm up like so or I can use pronated grips where my hand is palm down.
wavs/63.wav|As a general rule, when Matheus' hand is above his chest, we use supinated grips.
wavs/64.wav|And when Matheus' hand is below his chest, we generally use pronated grips.
wavs/65.wav|When we first see someone by the wrist, I generally prefer to see you grip with the thumb.
wavs/66.wav|How you choose to finish is up to you, some people prefer no thumb, some people prefer the thumb.
wavs/67.wav|People's arms have been badly broken using both methods so it doesn't really make that much of a difference.
wavs/68.wav|But when you first go to control someone's wrist, it does make a difference.
wavs/69.wav|When we go to secure, we use the thumb to secure, whether it's pronated whether it's supinated.
wavs/70.wav|So let's start off with the idea of elbow penetration on an opponent who has his arms in a good sound defensive position.
wavs/71.wav|First things first, if I'm gonna use the elbow penetration method, I can't do it from a perpendicular side position.
wavs/72.wav|It's not gonna work.
wavs/73.wav|I need to move to a north south position.
wavs/74.wav|I'm across my training partner's side just like so.
wavs/75.wav|I'm gonna take my thumb and I'm gonna go underneath my training partner's triceps.
wavs/76.wav|I bring my thumb underneath, as far as it'll go.
wavs/77.wav|It may not be that far if my opponent's arms are very tight.
wavs/78.wav|But he knows that and he's keeping his arms in very very tight.
wavs/79.wav|So I'm gonna bring my hand up as far as it'll go.
wavs/80.wav|Your thumb will only go so far before his strong arm prevents any further movement.
wavs/81.wav|Once we've gone as far as we can, we're gonna put our hand across and we're gonna bring our elbow forward.
wavs/82.wav|The further my elbow is back towards my opponent's shoulder, the less effective I will be at penetrating.
wavs/83.wav|Here if he makes a strong defensive arm and I try to lift that's just my biceps working against him.
wavs/84.wav|So what I want to do in these situations is bring my whole elbow forward.
wavs/85.wav|Then I start to drive towards the opposite hip.
wavs/86.wav|My whole body goes forward and my legs get my opponent moving.
wavs/87.wav|What I'm trying to do is to take Matheus' elbow as high as possible.
wavs/88.wav|The lower his elbow down towards the floor, the harder it is for me to get underneath and penetrate through the elbow.
wavs/89.wav|So my whole thing from the north south position is from here to bring my elbow forward and then we start a drive across that raises his elbow.
wavs/90.wav|Once the elbow is raised, I change my wrist position.
wavs/91.wav|From the palm up position I take my legs and knees off the mat.
wavs/92.wav|And from this position I physically push his wrist over my hand.
wavs/93.wav|I'm gonna demonstrate on the other side.
wavs/94.wav|The problem here is how am I gonna get my hand into this position, which I need.
wavs/95.wav|From the north south, my hand goes under, my head goes forward and I start that drive across the body.
wavs/96.wav|Now you can clearly see, it's very very hard for me to penetrate underneath.
wavs/97.wav|So I take the heel of my hand and no matter how strong he makes his arms I can always push the hand forward.
wavs/98.wav|As the hand goes forward I now get space to bring my hand through.
wavs/99.wav|Once the hand is through, we're in the perfect position to lock the figure of four.
wavs/100.wav|As always, my middle finger controls the bend of the wrist on both my wrist and his.
